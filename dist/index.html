In other words, just how long should it take to bring an accused to trial?</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;I said, &#x2018;Having thought about it for two minutes, it&#x2019;s probably better than what we have right now,&#x2019; &#x201D; Gottardi, a Vancouver-based lawyer, told the Star in a recent interview. &#x201C;He said, &#x2018;What do you think about 30 months?&#x2019; I said &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know, what about 24?&#x2019;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;So I got the sense they were thinking of doing something creative, but when they came out and did it, it was actually a bit of a surprise, and I still don&#x2019;t know if the decision is a good one or not.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">That decision, released last year, was R v. Jordan, which takes its name from Gottardi&#x2019;s client, Barrett Jordan, a Surrey, B.C., man who was arrested on drug charges and whose case took four years to get to trial.</p></div><div class="show-for-small-only alpha__big-box " data-reactid="189"><div class="article-continued" data-reactid="190"><div class="article-continued__heading" data-reactid="191">Article Continued Below</div></div><div class="alpha__big-box__body" data-reactid="192"><div class="big-box" data-reactid="193"><!-- react-empty: 194 --></div></div></div><div data-reactid="195"><p itemprop="articleBody">It was good news for Jordan himself, as the top court&#x2019;s 5-4 decision stayed the charges against him, finding his constitutional right to a trial in a reasonable time, enshrined in section 11 (b) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, had been violated.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">But a good decision for the country? It depends on who you ask.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Along with staying the charges against Jordan, the majority went further and completely revamped the legal framework that guides judges in deciding if a person has been tried within a reasonable time.</p></div><div id="fsk_splitbox" data-reactid="196"></div><!-- react-empty: 197 --><div data-reactid="198"><p itemprop="articleBody">They implemented new so-called &#x201C;numerical ceilings&#x201D; after calling out what they described as a &#x201C;culture of complacency&#x201D; in the Canadian justice system.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">The five judges found that the period between an accused person&#x2019;s arrest and the anticipated conclusion of their trial in provincial court should not exceed 18 months, and should not go over 30 months in Superior Court, which handles the most serious crimes such as murder.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Once those ceilings have been breached, the delay is considered &#x201C;presumptively unreasonable&#x201D; and the case is tossed unless the Crown can prove there are exceptional circumstances, such as the complexity of the case. Delay caused by the defence does not count in the calculation.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Already, <a onclick="theStarLinkClick(event, this)" href="https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2017/02/21/judges-point-to-crowns-failure-as-brampton-drug-cases-collapse.html">dozens of cases in Ontario alone</a> have been stayed under the Jordan framework, with the public becoming particularly familiar with the name when an Ottawa judge threw out a first-degree murder charge against ex-soldier Adam Picard, who was accused of killing 28-year-old Fouad Nayel, after it took four years to bring his case to trial.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">The Crown has appealed the Picard decision, seeking clarity on how to properly evaluate delay in so-called &#x201C;transitional cases,&#x201D; meaning cases that were already in the system before the release of the Jordan decision.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;A presumptive ceiling is required in order to give meaningful direction to the state on its constitutional obligations and to those who play an important role in ensuring that the trial concludes within a reasonable time,&#x201D; Moldaver, along with Justices Andromache Karakatsanis and Russell Brown, wrote for the majority.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;It is also intended to provide some assurance to accused persons, to victims and their families, to witnesses, and to the public that s. 11(b) is not a hollow promise.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Almost anyone who regularly toils in courthouses across Ontario &#x2014; judges, prosecutors and defence lawyers &#x2014; would say that despite previous rulings on delays from the Supreme Court and judicial warnings from lower courts, successive federal and provincial governments have failed to properly resource the justice system in a way that would ensure its fairness and efficiency.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;It is time for our senior levels of government to commit to a strategy that will ensure that these constitutionally guaranteed objectives are met,&#x201D; Judge Peter Wright of the Ontario Court of Justice wrote in a decision in January 2010, staying drug charges due to delay.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;Government has had more than 20 years to improve upon the systemic deficiencies which continue to erode the constitutional rights protected by s. 11(b) of our Charter &#x2014; for the benefit of persons charged and for our society alike. Yet the situation only grows worse by the day.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">So Jordan was, in principle, a necessary jolt to the system, legal observers say. The resulting stay of charges, particularly in the Picard case, has in turn incensed the public, which has pushed politicians into action.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;If victims are mad at anybody, they should not be mad at the courts, they should be mad at governments, which have consistently made business decisions to underfund the system in the expectations that judges will let them off the hook,&#x201D; said lawyer Frank Addario, who represented Ontario&#x2019;s Criminal Lawyers&#x2019; Association as an intervener in the Jordan case.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;All the Supreme Court of Canada has done is say that when you continually violate the constitution, we&#x2019;re obliged to give the defendant a remedy. It&#x2019;s not a reward. It&#x2019;s a remedy for a past violation . . . It&#x2019;s easy to avoid if you don&#x2019;t make the business decision to violate the right to a speedy trial.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">In the aftermath of Jordan, provincial governments have poured millions of dollars into beefing up the justice system. In Ontario, Attorney General Yasir Naqvi announced that <a onclick="theStarLinkClick(event, this)" href="https://www.thestar.com/news/queenspark/2016/12/01/ontario-to-tackle-court-delays-by-hiring-more-judges-prosecutors.html">the government would appoint 13 new judges to the Ontario Court of Justice</a> and 32 new Crown prosecutors, among other changes, though critics say that still falls short of what is needed.</p><p itemprop="articleBody"><a onclick="theStarLinkClick(event, this)" href="https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2017/02/21/ontarios-attorney-general-calls-on-federal-counterpart-to-speed-up-justice-system.html">Naqvi is also pleading</a> with federal Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to fill the 11 judicial vacancies in the under-resourced Superior Court.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">He told the Star that he&#x2019;s hearing more and more stories of it taking much longer now <a onclick="theStarLinkClick(event, this)" href="https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2017/01/23/ontario-lawyers-warn-civil-court-delays-a-worsening-disaster.html">to schedule civil and family matters in Superior Court</a> &#x2014; cases which do not carry the same constitutional right for a trial in a reasonable time.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;All because resources are being diverted to deal with criminal matters in response to Jordan timelines,&#x201D; Naqvi said. &#x201C;The issue has a domino effect. As much as we are focused on the criminal justice system, we also have a responsibility to civil and family law. That&#x2019;s why I feel it&#x2019;s even more imperative that we find an expedited way of filling those vacancies.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Jordan&#x2019;s lawyers, along with the Criminal Lawyers&#x2019; Association and others, had asked the Supreme Court to &#x201C;recalibrate&#x201D; the rather flexible legal analysis around delay, arguing that far too often cases were still going to trial despite having spent years in the system.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">And while the court certainly did proceed to recalibrate, they also came up with their own numbers: 18 and 30.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Therein lies the problem, experts say, not to mention the four Supreme Court judges who did not agree with Moldaver and company. None of the lawyers proposed those numbers. None of the lawyers were asked for submissions on those numbers.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;They invented them,&#x201D; Addario said of the numerical ceilings.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">The majority explained that they reached the new framework after conducting a &#x201C;qualitative review&#x201D; of almost every reported decision on delay from appeal courts in the last 10 years, and many rulings from trial courts.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;By reading these cases with the new framework in mind, we were able to get a rough sense of how the new framework would have played out in some past cases,&#x201D; the majority wrote. &#x201C;Indeed, we note that in the seminal case of Askov, the delay was in the range of 30 months, as it was in Godin some 19 years later, and in both cases, this court found the delays to be unreasonable.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">The now-retired Justice Thomas Cromwell, writing for the minority, which included Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin, pulled no punches in calling out the majority for swooping in with the new numbers without any debate. (The minority also concluded that in Jordan&#x2019;s case, specifically, the delay was unreasonable and they agreed his charges should be stayed.)</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Cromwell said he &#x201C;fundamentally&#x201D; disagreed with the approach of the majority, calling it &#x201C;both unwarranted and unwise.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;Based on the limited evidence in the record, the presumptive time periods proposed by my colleagues are unlikely to improve the pace at which the vast majority of cases move through the system while risking judicial stays in potentially thousands of cases,&#x201D; he wrote.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;One of the themes that appears throughout the court&#x2019;s jurisprudence on the right to be tried within a reasonable time is that reasonableness cannot be judicially defined with precision or captured by a number. The proposed ceilings are deeply inconsistent with this constant in our jurisprudence.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">The focal point of Cromwell&#x2019;s reasons is that determining whether an accused has been tried within a reasonable time is &#x201C;inherently case-specific,&#x201D; and should take into account a balancing of several factors, including society&#x2019;s interests in bringing a case to trial, especially when a very serious offence has been committed.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;If there are exceptionally strong societal interests in the prosecution of a case against an accused which substantially outweigh the societal interest and the interest of the accused person in prompt trials, these can serve as an &#x2018;acceptable basis&#x2019; upon which exceeding the inherent and institutional requirements of a case can be justified,&#x201D; Cromwell wrote.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">The Supreme Court majority noted that the ceiling is not an &#x201C;aspirational target,&#x201D; and that the public should expect that most cases are still resolved before coming close to 18 or 30 months.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">They left the door open to the defence to still argue unreasonable delay even if the ceiling has not been breached, as long as the defence can prove they took &#x201C;meaningful steps that demonstrate a sustained effort to expedite the proceedings&#x201D; and that the case took &#x201C;markedly longer&#x201D; than it should have. But the majority also admitted that stays in such cases would be &#x201C;rare.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Defence lawyers, as well as the Supreme Court minority, took issue with this, as the onus to bring an accused to trial in a reasonable time has always been on the Crown.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s the Crown&#x2019;s obligation, and yet the defence lawyer needs to essentially participate or take a significantly active role in bringing their own client to trial,&#x201D; said Toronto criminal defence lawyer Daniel Brown.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;That wasn&apos;t the law before, it said we can&apos;t forget that it&apos;s the Crown&apos;s duty to bring an accused to trial, and as long as the defence lawyer wasn&#x2019;t standing in the way of that, there wasn&apos;t this obligation imposed on them.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Criminal defence lawyers in Ontario have said the 18-month ceiling in provincial court is too high, saying the average time in the Ontario Court of Justice is closer to the 12-month range.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">As for Superior Court &#x2014; where the seriousness of offences, jury trials and other factors add to the complexity &#x2014; some have voiced concern the 30-month ceiling may be too low.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">While the Supreme Court majority may have said the ceilings are not &#x201C;aspirational targets,&#x201D; that would not appear to be the actual reality in the lower courts post-Jordan, as defence lawyers have spoken of the prosecution and the courts putting off dealing with their cases in a quicker fashion because they&#x2019;re not close to the ceiling.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Brown said the new reality is that an accused person who isn&#x2019;t nearing the ceiling can actually be penalized for taking every step to get to trial as quickly as possible.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;You&#x2019;re the first case to get bumped,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;Because their case is no longer in jeopardy of being delayed, they&#x2019;re easily moved to a new court date, meaning the accused has to re-prepare their case, their life remains on hold, the defence lawyer has to charge an extra fee.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">For example, Brown spoke of a client charged with sexual assault two years ago who was set to go on trial last month, but the case got pushed to August. &#x201C;They said there are other cases that have taken longer than yours,&#x201D; Brown said.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Defence lawyers have also complained of important procedural rights for their clients being bypassed to save time, such as the Crown seeking what are known as &#x201C;preferred indictments&#x201D; to send an accused straight to trial without first having a preliminary hearing.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;My view is that the (Jordan) decision is going to do far more harm than good for accused individuals,&#x201D; said Toronto criminal defence lawyer Sean Robichaud. &#x201C;Protections that accused persons would otherwise enjoy are being sacrificed, or waived under coercive circumstances, to avoid a problem they often did not contribute towards.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">The lasting impact of R v. Jordan may not be known for several years. Appeals of stays of proceedings, such as the Picard murder case, are moving through the courts. One or more of them will likely end up before the Supreme Court, where the majority said that the numbers they imposed may need to be revisited one day.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;I still don&#x2019;t know what to think of it,&#x201D; Gottardi, Jordan&#x2019;s lawyer, told the Star.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;I really do think it took some courage to write it. Whether they&#x2019;re right or wrong, time will be the judge of that. It threw out 20 years of jurisprudence and we need a better way. This might not be a better way, but it&#x2019;s thinking outside the usual box, and courts don&#x2019;t often do that. They get credit for that in my books.&#x201D;</p></div><div class="show-for-medium-only alpha__big-box star-touch-banner__article" data-reactid="199"><div class="alpha__big-box__body" data-reactid="200"><div class="" data-reactid="201"><!-- react-empty: 202 --></div></div></div><!-- react-empty: 203 --><div class="newsletter-box show-for-small-only" data-reactid="204"><div class="newsletter-box__body" data-reactid="205"><div class="newsletter-box__body-content" data-reactid="206"><div data-reactid="207"><span class="resist-font-resizer" data-reactid="208">Delivered daily</span><span class="newsletter-box__heading" data-reactid="209">The Morning Headlines&#xA0;Newsletter</span><div class="clearfix" data-reactid="210"><div class="newsletter-box__input-box" data-reactid="211"><input type="email" value="" placeholder="Enter your email address" aria-label="Your email address" class="" data-reactid="212"></div><button class="button" data-reactid="213">Subscribe</button></div></div></div><p class="newsletter-box__legal" data-reactid="214"><!-- react-text: 215 -->The Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E&#xA0;1E6.

In March 2015, she dropped into a San Diego-area pet store looking for an English bulldog. She walked out with a golden retriever.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">That wasn&#x2019;t so strange, even if $2,400 (all figures US) was more than she&#x2019;d intended to spend. (There&#x2019;s a reason pet stores put puppies in the window.) The odd part came a few weeks later, when she and her husband were going over their credit reports and saw a $5,800 charge from a company they&#x2019;d never heard of.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">The Sabins had bought their new dog, Tucker, with financing offered at the pet store through a company called Wags Lending, which assigned the contract to an Oceanside, Calif.-based firm that collects on consumer debt. But when Dawn tracked down a customer service rep at that firm, Monterey Financial Services Inc., she learned she didn&#x2019;t own the dog after all.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;I asked them: &#x2018;How in the heck can I owe $5,800 when I bought the dog for $2,400?&#x2019; They told me, &#x2018;You&#x2019;re not financing the dog, you&#x2019;re leasing.&#x2019; &#x2018;You mean to tell me I&#x2019;m renting a dog?&#x2019; And they were like, &#x2018;Yeah.&#x2019; &#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Without quite realizing it, the Sabins had agreed to make 34 monthly lease payments of $165.06, after which they had the right to buy the dog for about two months&#x2019; rent. Miss a payment, and the lender could take back the dog. If Tucker ran away or chased the proverbial fire truck all the way to doggy heaven, the Sabins would be on the hook for an early repayment charge. If they saw the lease through to the end, they would have paid the equivalent of more than 70 per cent in annualized interest &#x2014; nearly twice what most credit card lenders charge.</p></div><div class="show-for-small-only alpha__big-box " data-reactid="148"><div class="article-continued" data-reactid="149"><div class="article-continued__heading" data-reactid="150">Article Continued Below</div></div><div class="alpha__big-box__body" data-reactid="151"><div class="big-box" data-reactid="152"><!-- react-empty: 153 --></div></div></div><div data-reactid="154"><p itemprop="articleBody">If that weren&#x2019;t bad enough, Dawn Sabins soon decided Tucker was too rambunctious for her family&#x2019;s home. She called the pet store and threatened to leave the pup tied up outside the store, then decided on what she thought a more humane path. She sold the dog to a local trainer for $500, stopped making payments on the lease, and spent 18 months griping in online reviews and emails.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">She wasn&#x2019;t alone.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;There is just no way I should pay over $5,000 for a $2,000 puppy,&#x201D; wrote one customer in an April 2014 complaint collected by&#xA0;the Federal Trade Commission after financing a Yorkshire terrier from a Kennesaw, Ga., pet store with a lease from Wags Lending. (That complaint and the others that follow were directed at Monterey Financial by customers who had financed high-end pets through Wags Lending.) &#x201C;The rep &#x2026; told me the payments I had been making are rental [fees],&#x201D; wrote another surprised lessee. &#x201C;For a dog??

Because others, like Sabins, are more eager to bring home their new furry friend than to read the fine print of their contract. But mostly because &#x2014; thanks to a 36-year-old Nevadan who ditched a career in private equity to help subprime borrowers finance purebred pets &#x2014; they can.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;When I take a good hard look at what the world will be like in 10 years, I think most things are going to be on lease,&#x201D; said Dusty Wunderlich, chief executive officer of Bristlecone Holdings LLC, the Reno, Nev.-based company that operates Wags Lending.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">It was Monday morning at the company&#x2019;s offices, across the Truckee River from Reno&#x2019;s seedy downtown, and Wunderlich was dressed in ostrich-skin boots and a flat-brimmed baseball cap &#x2014; the same kind of Western spin on startup chic that animates his company, named for a species of pine tree native to Nevada that can live for thousands of years.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Wunderlich rents his apartment. He leases his car. He owns his horse. He&#x2019;s drawn to the rugged individualism expressed in the novels of Ayn Rand and the blog Cowboy Ethics, but he hastens to argue that while he profits off high-cost lending, he&#x2019;s also improving the lives of subprime borrowers. He is, he writes in a mission statement on his personal website, &#x201C;living in a Postmodern culture while maintaining my old American West roots and Christian values.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Wunderlich dreamed up Wags Lending in 2013, then used the pet-leasing business to launch an improbable collection of financing vehicles &#x2014; writing leases against furniture, wedding dresses, hearing aids and custom auto rims. In a little more than three years, his company has originated 66,000 leases for just over $100 million. He once worked out a plan to lease cattle to dairy farmers, though plummeting commodity prices soured the economics. (He got far enough to decide that if a cow gave birth during the terms of the lease, the lessee got to keep the calf.) In another idea that never reached the market, he explored lease financing for funerals.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;We like niches where we&#x2019;re dealing with emotional borrowers,&#x201D; Wunderlich said.</p><p itemprop="articleBody"><strong>Credit for everyone</strong></p><p itemprop="articleBody">Bristlecone is transparent about the lease structure in its contract language and in online marketing, Wunderlich said. The company relies on retailers to communicate the terms of its contracts, he said, which sometimes leads to confusion. Even so, he said, complaints about costs or structure are &#x201C;fringe cases,&#x201D; and Bristlecone offers a money-back guarantee for the first 30 days. After that, the company tries to satisfy customers who complain. &#x201C;If a customer feels misled, we want to work out a way for them to get out of the contract.&#x201D; Bristlecone spokeswoman Brooke Rose said in an email that after the Sabins complained, the company offered to let them out of the lease for Tucker&#x2019;s retail price but didn&#x2019;t hear back.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">As for Monterey Financial, the company to which Wags assigns some contracts, its chief executive Chris Hughes said in an email that it &#x201C;addresses any and all consumer complaints until there is a resolution.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">In Wunderlich&#x2019;s telling, U.S. lenders do a good job of pricing credit for prime borrowers, lowering their interest rates as their credit scores rise. But lenders have taken a cruder approach with the millions of subprime borrowers, extending the same high interest rates to large swaths, regardless of their individual credit histories. Wunderlich says he wants to &#x201C;democratize access to credit through dynamic pricing across the credit spectrum&#x201D; &#x2014; a fancy way of saying his customers pay rates based on their own ability to repay, not someone else&#x2019;s.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Fast, technology-driven underwriting has become table stakes for online lenders in the age of cloud computing, with a range of companies promising to make credit decisions more quickly than traditional banks. Bristlecone&#x2019;s main innovation is to apply that kind of underwriting to leases. Unlike credit cards and instalment loans, which are subject to usury laws in many states, closed-end leases face no caps on how much a financing company can charge.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">That lets Bristlecone charge effective interest rates ranging from about 36 per cent to 170 per cent on an annualized basis, based on sample rates published on its website. (Bristlecone doesn&#x2019;t express its pricing in terms of APR, since Wunderlich says it underwrites leases, not loans. The effective interest rates quoted here represent the rates borrowers would pay if they took out term loans with the same payback costs and schedule as a Bristlecone lease.) Those rates may sound high to borrowers used to paying 15 per cent on their credit card, but Wunderlich says they&#x2019;re a fraction of what payday and other subprime lenders charge.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;When you really look at how the credit situation is set up in the United States, it&#x2019;s highly discriminatory,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;People are like, &#x2018;Oh, high interest rates, that&#x2019;s bad.&#x2019; But it&#x2019;s like &#x2014; not really. It can be. But if used properly, it can be very good.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody"><strong>Selling mattresses to brothels</strong></p><p itemprop="articleBody">Wunderlich grew up in Elko, Nev., home to one of the largest gold-mining operations in the U.S. His parents managed local casinos; his grandfather once owned a furniture store that sold mattresses to the local brothels. Dusty won a golf scholarship to Missouri State University, earned two business degrees, then moved back to Nevada to work as an analyst at a gaming company. There, he struck up a golf-course friendship with a financier named Alfred Villalobos whose firm, Arvco Financial Ventures LLC, helped hedge funds and private equity firms win business from the California Public Employees&#x2019; Retirement System.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Villalobos took Wunderlich under his wing, hired him in 2006, and sent him around the globe in search of investors for deals in the new energy sector. But in 2010, Wunderlich felt an itch to strike out on his own. Nevada&#x2019;s public school system had just established a fund to make private equity investments in local businesses, and Wunderlich set up a one-man advisory firm to help the state score deals. (He picked the right time to make the career move: Villalobos later was criminally charged with bribing the former head of CALPERS and pleaded not guilty. He committed suicide in 2015. His lawyers said at the time that he had been ill for at least two years.)</p><p itemprop="articleBody">The advisory business was slow going. Wunderlich merged it into a Sacramento-based investment bank, where he did advisory work for a paddleboard company and considered buying into a company raising money from Chinese investors for luxury real estate projects. Then he saw his opportunity: A lender specializing in financing furniture, electric scooters and all-terrain vehicles was looking for a buyer, and it fell to him to examine the books. The deal fell through, but he came away impressed by the economics of high-interest loans.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">It was 2012, still early in the U.S. economy&#x2019;s slow recovery, and&#xA0;Reno home prices&#xA0;were less than half of&#xA0;their boom-time highs. Local unemployment was at 12 per cent. And Wunderlich noticed something else: Spending on restaurant meals had plunged during the recession, according to Census data, but spending on pet food had ticked up.</p></div><figure class="image" data-reactid="170"><div class="image__body " data-reactid="171"><img src="https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/news/insight/2017/03/19/when-subprime-meets-purebred-rental-pets-and-ruined-credit-scores/mirror-dalmations.jpg.size.custom.crop.850x567.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 850px) 850px, 100vw" srcset="https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/news/insight/2017/03/19/when-subprime-meets-purebred-rental-pets-and-ruined-credit-scores/mirror-dalmations.jpg.size.custom.crop.320x213.jpg 320w, https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/news/insight/2017/03/19/when-subprime-meets-purebred-rental-pets-and-ruined-credit-scores/mirror-dalmations.jpg.size.custom.crop.480x320.jpg 480w, https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/news/insight/2017/03/19/when-subprime-meets-purebred-rental-pets-and-ruined-credit-scores/mirror-dalmations.jpg.size.custom.crop.640x426.jpg 640w, https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/news/insight/2017/03/19/when-subprime-meets-purebred-rental-pets-and-ruined-credit-scores/mirror-dalmations.jpg.size.custom.crop.850x567.jpg 850w" alt="Today, Americans can lease a labradoodle or a dalmation.

Then their point-of-sale lease financing became a hit and they decided to double down on it.</p><p></p><p itemprop="articleBody">Rebranding as Bristlecone, they began rolling out new lending verticals, like I Do Lending (for bridal shops) and OneRoad Lending (for auto shops). Volumes soared from $15 million in 2014 to $38 million the next year. But as a startup lender with little history of making performing loans, Bristlecone was borrowing at interest rates as high as 20 per cent. It was hard to profit at those rates, so it sold some contracts to other companies.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Wunderlich began poaching programmers from a software company that writes code for video slot machines. He staffed his executive ranks with fellow Nevadans like Ferguson and Jeffrey Jones, the son of a commodity trader who&#x2019;d buried burlap sacks full of pennies in his backyard and had told his kids to dig them up once the copper was worth more than the pennies. He penned a memo on &#x201C;ranch-style culture&#x201D; to instill in his new recruits what he called &#x201C;cowboy virtues&#x201D; &#x2014; humility, ingenuity, accountability.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">In 2014, Bristlecone landed a meeting with SenaHill Partners LP, a New York-based merchant bank firm that invests in financial technology startups. It didn&#x2019;t take long for Justin Brownhill, a partner at SenaHill, to sense an opportunity in the company&#x2019;s data-driven lending model and point-of-sale marketing strategy. Five minutes into the meeting, Brownhill excused himself. &#x201C;I walked out and grabbed my three other partners and said, &#x2018;I think we have something special here,&#x2019; &#x201D; Brownhill said.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Wunderlich parlayed that meeting into a seed round of $1.1 million.&#xA0;SenaHill also connected him with a firm that furnished Bristlecone with a $75 million line of credit, lowering Bristlecone&#x2019;s borrowing costs.</p><p itemprop="articleBody"></p><p annotation="note"><subhead name="subhead" class="paragraph" displayname="subhead">Luxury pets for the poor</subhead></p><p></p><p itemprop="articleBody">Banking to customers underserved by traditional financial services was a $141 billion industry in 2015, according to a recent report from the Center for Financial Services Innovation &#x2014; a tally that includes pawn loans, subprime credit cards, overdraft charges and other products that can carry annualized interest well into the triple digits. Wunderlich presents his leases as something of a lesser evil compared with them.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">That argument is more convincing for some products than others. For a subprime customer in the market for a dining room set, a Bristlecone lease might offer a better deal than a rent-to-own retailer, which can charge effective APRs of more than 300 per cent. Most payday-loan borrowers, on the other hand, use that cash to pay bills; less than one in 10 uses it to buy something, notes Nick Bourke, director of consumer finance at Pew Charitable Trusts. In other words, Bristlecone&#x2019;s dog leases might not be replacing more expensive credit. They may just offer a new way for subprime borrowers to buy things they can&#x2019;t afford.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;We&#x2019;re all for going to the shelter and adopting a dog,&#x201D; Wunderlich answers. &#x201C;But if a person wants a chiweenie, they&#x2019;re not going to go to a shelter and find a chiweenie.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">On its website, Wags Lending offers happy testimonials from effusive but anonymous pet owners who used lease financing to buy pups. When asked to furnish a satisfied customer&#xA0;for an interview, the company suggested Elizabeth Harvey, a college student,&#xA0;and Kristin Smith, a Reno salon owner.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Harvey, 24, used a Wags lease to take home a chihuahua from an Erie, Pa., pet store. In the past, Harvey said, she had adopted rescues. The contract was expensive, but she was already enamored of the pooch, which she named Little. Later, once she&#x2019;d taken Little home and realized she was leasing him, she called Wags to complain, and the company waived several months&#x2019; worth of payments. &#x201C;I probably wouldn&#x2019;t feel so thankful if it was any other dog,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;For some reason, I just connected to this one.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Smith, 40, has used leases from Bristlecone for two dogs, both morkies &#x2014; a Maltese-Yorkie hybrid. She bought the first dog, Julius, on a whim after walking into a local pet store without a credit card. &#x201C;It was like, I didn&#x2019;t want to leave without him,&#x201D; she said. After Julius was killed in a traffic accident, Smith worked with Bristlecone to craft a lease for a new dog, which she named Monsieur Fluffington (&#x201C;the smaller the dog, the longer the name&#x201D;).&#xA0;&#x201C;I can&#x2019;t say enough good things about Wags,&#x201D; she said.</p><p itemprop="articleBody"><strong>Lease, or legal dodge?</strong></p></div><figure class="image" data-reactid="182"><div class="image__body " data-reactid="183"><img src="https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/news/insight/2017/03/19/when-subprime-meets-purebred-rental-pets-and-ruined-credit-scores/superdog.jpg.size.custom.crop.850x567.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 850px) 850px, 100vw" srcset="https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/news/insight/2017/03/19/when-subprime-meets-purebred-rental-pets-and-ruined-credit-scores/superdog.jpg.size.custom.crop.320x213.jpg 320w, https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/news/insight/2017/03/19/when-subprime-meets-purebred-rental-pets-and-ruined-credit-scores/superdog.jpg.size.custom.crop.480x320.jpg 480w, https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/news/insight/2017/03/19/when-subprime-meets-purebred-rental-pets-and-ruined-credit-scores/superdog.jpg.size.custom.crop.640x426.jpg 640w, https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/news/insight/2017/03/19/when-subprime-meets-purebred-rental-pets-and-ruined-credit-scores/superdog.jpg.size.custom.crop.850x567.jpg 850w" alt="Fast, technology-driven underwriting has allowed lenders to make credit decisions quickly -- even to for unusual purchases.

The papers described a lease transaction for two teacup Yorkies underwritten by Wags Lending.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Saunders, whose title is &#x201C;of counsel&#x201D; to the National Consumer Law Center, thought the contract looked like it might not hold up as a lease in court.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Under the federal Consumer Leasing Act, the defining characteristic of a lease is that the lessor can take back and remarket the underlying asset. That distinction, Saunders said, has been crucial to convincing lawmakers that leases are different from loans and shouldn&#x2019;t be subject to caps on interest rates.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Saunders didn&#x2019;t think the contract for the teacup Yorkies met that standard. Before she could pursue a lawsuit, though, the lessee settled her complaint for a refund.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Now, Saunders is looking for another aggrieved customer so she can test the legality of the contract in court, on the theory that a dog can&#x2019;t be redeemed and resold at the end of a lease, as a car might be. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s no real contemplation with a dog that you&#x2019;re going to run it back in.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Wunderlich says his company&#x2019;s contracts legally qualify as leases. When the company can&#x2019;t get pet stores to take back dogs, he said, Bristlecone itself works to find new owners, sometimes flying the dogs back to Nevada.</p><p itemprop="articleBody"></p><p annotation="note"><subhead name="subhead" class="paragraph" displayname="subhead">Labradoodles and beyond </subhead></p><p></p><p itemprop="articleBody">For now, Wunderlich is still focused on launching new credit products. He recently finalized a deal with a Utah-based bank that helps online lenders use the state&#x2019;s lender-friendly laws to make loans elsewhere. That will let Bristlecone expand its product offerings to include term loans, allowing it to extend more enticing rates to borrowers with better credit profiles and to finance services like veterinary care, elective surgery, even funerals &#x2014; not just tangible assets like dairy cows and labradoodles.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;We&#x2019;ve gone a long way to making sure that what we&#x2019;re doing is within the confines of the law,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;Is there a regulator one day that&#x2019;s going to just absolutely not like what we do and pick a fight with us? Probably. And we&#x2019;ll have to hash it out.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">For Sabins, getting out of her lease contract turned into a lengthy ordeal.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">When she first figured out that she was leasing Tucker, she complained to both Monterey Financial and Bristlecone. She stopped making payments and stopped worrying about the charge, until she and her husband looked into refinancing their home and realized the unresolved lease was marring their credit report. By then, she&#x2019;d already sold the dog.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">This past June, she reached out to Wags again. In July, Wags promised to clear up her credit report. In October, it refunded her the lease payments she made.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">She still worries the transaction will come back to haunt her. Before she took Tucker home back in early 2015, the dog&#xA0;had a microchip implanted under his skin to register him with the American Kennel Club. When she sold him, she forgot to ask the buyer to update the registration.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Every now and then, unease gnaws at her.

His music became tradition at that point.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Although his music was rooted in the blues, Berry developed a clearer, more accessible singing style geared to a broader audience. He had been deeply influenced by Nat King Cole, the jazz pianist and crooner known for his impeccable diction. </p><p itemprop="articleBody">By the late 1950s, Berry was one of the new music&#x2019;s most prominent stars. He toured with disc jockey Alan Freed&#x2019;s 1957 rock-and-roll revue and appeared in teen-centric movies including <em>Rock, Rock, Rock!</em> (1956) and <em>Go, Johnny, Go!</em> (1959).</p><p itemprop="articleBody"></p><p annotation="note">Despite Berry&#x2019;s charisma, race played a factor in preventing him from achieving Elvis-like levels of commercial success in Hollywood and Las Vegas. He had hits including &#x201C;No Particular Place to Go&#x201D; (1964) and &#x201C;Dear Dad&#x201D; (1965) and appeared in <em>The T.A.M.I.

Hail! Rock &#x2018;n&#x2019; Roll</em>, a documentary and concert film directed by Taylor Hackford and featuring guest performers including Keith Richards, Eric Clapton and Ronstadt.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">At the time, Berry said he was wary of accepting a crown &#x2014; bestowed by critics or peers &#x2014; as a &#x201C;king&#x201D; of rock music.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;What the heck is a king?&#x201D; he told The Washington Post. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m a cog in the wheel. My portion might have been greater than some other guy&#x2019;s, but some other guy&#x2019;s, I&#x2019;m sure, was greater than mine in some avenues.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s not me to toot my horn,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;The minute you toot your horn, it seems like society will try and disconnect your battery. And if you do not toot your horn, they&#x2019;ll try their darnedest to give you a horn to toot, or say that you should have a horn.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s them that creates the demand, so let them toot the horn.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Charles Edward Anderson Berry was born on Oct. 18, 1926, in St. Louis. His father was a carpenter and handyman. The family &#x2014; which included six children &#x2014; lived in the Ville, a middle-class African-American neighbourhood.</p><p itemprop="articleBody"></p><p annotation="note">He was 14 when he began playing guitar and performing at parties, but that was interrupted by a three-year stint in reform school for his role in a bungled armed robbery. After his release, he worked for his father and on an automobile assembly line while studying for a career in hairdressing.</p><p></p><p itemprop="articleBody">On weekends, he sang at the Cosmopolitan Club in East St. Louis, Illinois, with a group led by pianist Johnnie Johnson, who later played on many of Berry&#x2019;s records. </p><p itemprop="articleBody">At the urging of Muddy Waters, Berry took his demo tapes to Chess Records, the Chicago label that specialized in blues and urban rhythm-and-blues. Label owner Leonard Chess was impressed by &#x201C;Ida May,&#x201D; a country-and-western-styled tune, and said he would allow Berry to record it if he would change the name to &#x201C;Maybellene.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">The song&#x2019;s countrified style and Berry&#x2019;s non-bluesy intonation reportedly led many disc jockeys to assume that he was white, and the song&#x2019;s popularity with white record-buyers helped spur his quick rise in the music industry.</p><p itemprop="articleBody"></p><p annotation="note">&#x201C;I was 31,&#x201D; Berry said, &#x201C;and to sell in volume, I knew about that kind of commerce. I wasn&#x2019;t going to stay around the neighbourhood . . . I&#x2019;d rather give everybody in the country a little taste, &#x2019;cause that&#x2019;s far more in return than selling out in the neighborhood.&#x201D;</p><p></p><p itemprop="articleBody">His outspokenness was not always appreciated by music purists, but his savvy about the unsavory business practices of the day &#x2014; giving co-writing credits to deejays, such as Alan Freed, in exchange for frequent airplay &#x2014; propelled his career forward.</p><p itemprop="articleBody"></p><p annotation="note">But it was nearly derailed in 1959, when he was arrested on a federal charge of taking a 14-year-old girl across state lines for immoral purposes. He claimed that he didn&#x2019;t know the girl&#x2019;s age and had hired her to work as a hat-check girl in his nightclub. Berry was convicted but granted an appeal on the basis of racist remarks made by the judge. A second trial also ended in a conviction. Berry eventually served 18 months of a three-year sentence and paid a $10,000 fine.</p><p></p><p itemprop="articleBody">He was released in 1963, soon to find his career overtaken by a second wave of rockers and the so-called British invasion of bands, such as the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. He rebounded quickly in the music scene but at times continued to be drawn into the headlines by legal troubles.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">In 1979, he served four months in Lompoc Federal Prison in California for tax evasion. In his 1987 memoir, he joked about his various prison terms: &#x201C;My next fall is due around year end of 1996, so I have a while yet.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">It would come sooner. In 1989, Hosana Huck, a cook in Berry&#x2019;s St. Louis restaurant, the Southern Air, sued him, claiming that he secretly videotaped her and other women in the establishment&#x2019;s restroom. Huck&#x2019;s suit was followed by a class-action suit by other unnamed women. Berry denied any wrongdoing but settled out of court in 1995 for $1.5 million.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">In 1948, Berry married Themetta Suggs, known as Toddy. Information on survivors was not immediately available.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Berry received the top honours of his profession, including a Grammy Award for lifetime achievement in 1984 and the Kennedy Center Honors in 2000.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">In later years, when Berry reflected on his age, he always made it clear that he intended to keep rocking as long as he lived.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;Elvis&#x2019; songs will always be there, and I hope mine will be after I&#x2019;m gone,&#x201D; he told the Los Angeles Times in 2002. &#x201C;But you can&#x2019;t compare that, because he&#x2019;s gone and I&#x2019;m not!&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">On his 90th birthday last year, Berry disclosed that he would release <a onclick="theStarLinkClick(event, this)" href="https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/music/2016/10/18/chuck-berry-announces-surprise-album-on-his-90th-birthday.html">his first new album in 38 years in 2017</a>, titled simply: <em>Chuck</em>.

In some parts, one in four trees was an American chestnut. The trees were a refuge for hundreds of species and a thrumming industry: its wood was so hardy that chestnut fences still stake Ontario fields.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Then, in less than 50 years, the trees were gone. An exotic blight, accidentally carried over on an Asian chestnut variety, began infecting American chestnuts as the 20th century dawned.

By splicing a single gene from wheat into the tree&#x2019;s genome, scientists from the State University of New York&#x2019;s College of Environmental Science and Forestry (SUNY-ESF) have engineered blight-resistant saplings.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">This year, the team plans to apply for approval from U.S. and Canadian regulators to distribute the plant.

The American species, however, bore no natural resistance.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">It&#x2019;s hard to overstate the consequences of the loss of the American chestnut, ecologically, commercially and culturally. The trees dominated the forest canopy, produced massive volumes of nuts, and shed a particularly protein-rich leaf litter, providing shelter and nourishment for other species.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">When the tree was wiped out, multiple species of insects went extinct almost immediately, and many other animals, from deer to bears to wild turkeys, were impacted. Some scientists wonder whether the loss of the American chestnut contributed to the extinction of the passenger pigeon, since the soaring, 35-metre-high trees provided roosts for birds and both died out around the same time.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">As commercial timber, Americans &#x201C;called it the cradle to grave wood, since almost all everyday items were made of chestnut,&#x201D; says Ron Casier, chair of the Canadian Chestnut Council, a conservation group. Its supreme rot resistance made it a favourite for log cabins, flooring, and railroad ties. Nuts from the tree were a common food, as North American holiday traditions still suggest.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">In a single human generation, a geological wink, the tree disappeared.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;That&#x2019;s pretty much the most important wipeout of a species by a pathogen &#x2014; I can&#x2019;t think of anything else on that scale,&#x201D; says Richard Hamelin, a professor of forest pathology at the University of British Columbia.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Because the tree is so &#x201C;iconic,&#x201D; says Hamelin, &#x201C;ever since I did my PhD &#x2014; and before that, of course &#x2014; people have been interested in its restoration.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">The fungus creates cankers that girdle the trunk and branches, but it does not affect the roots. Decades after the trees died off, stump rings still pock the countryside, sending up shoots that then become infected and die. This cycle gives researchers hope &#x2014; and more importantly, if the trees survive long enough to flower, seeds.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">For decades, researchers have been trying to crossbreed the naturally resistant Asian chestnut species with the American. But the offspring of these trees are smaller hybrids, so the ones with blight resistance are then selected and &#x201C;back-crossed&#x201D; with another American chestnut tree to create offspring that are genetically truer to the endangered species.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Through enough generations of crossing and back-crossing, a tree that is blight-resistant and mostly American chestnut would be created. But the tree takes years to reach sexual maturity, so this research has been painstakingly slow, and has not yet produced trees with high levels of resistance.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Researchers also tried a tactic called hypovirulence, which uses a virus to infect the fungus, making it less potent. It didn&#x2019;t pan out, but it gave researchers a clue. The weaker strains of fungus produced less of a substance called oxalic acid &#x2014; a hint that this was the fungus&#x2019; weapon.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Powell and his colleagues noted that wheat and other grasses carry a gene that produces an enzyme that defangs oxalic acid, transforming it into two harmless byproducts, carbon dioxide and hydrogen peroxide. By splicing this gene into the American chestnut genome, the SUNY-ESF team theorized they could create a blight-resistant tree.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">It sounds simple. It took Powell and his colleagues 27 years. &#x201C;We started off when no one was doing this stuff,&#x201D; he says.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">The lab planted their first transgenic American chestnut trees in an outdoor research plot in 2006, ones with &#x201C;intermediate&#x201D; levels of blight resistance. Recent tests have shown even better defences, matching or surpassing the Asian trees; these highly resistant trees will be planted in the New York Botanical Garden this year.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">As early as summer, Powell and his team will begin applying to U.S. federal agencies for approval to distribute the plant to the public. As soon as those reviews are initiated, they will reformat their documents and submit to Environment Canada and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.</p></div><figure class="image" data-reactid="165"><div class="image__body " data-reactid="166"><img src="https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/news/world/2017/03/18/science-finds-a-way-to-bring-back-the-american-chestnut-tree/williampowell.jpg.size.custom.crop.850x624.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 850px) 850px, 100vw" srcset="https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/news/world/2017/03/18/science-finds-a-way-to-bring-back-the-american-chestnut-tree/williampowell.jpg.size.custom.crop.320x234.jpg 320w, https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/news/world/2017/03/18/science-finds-a-way-to-bring-back-the-american-chestnut-tree/williampowell.jpg.size.custom.crop.480x352.jpg 480w, https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/news/world/2017/03/18/science-finds-a-way-to-bring-back-the-american-chestnut-tree/williampowell.jpg.size.custom.crop.640x469.jpg 640w, https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/news/world/2017/03/18/science-finds-a-way-to-bring-back-the-american-chestnut-tree/williampowell.jpg.size.custom.crop.850x624.jpg 850w" alt="Professor William Powell hopes his team&apos;s research sets a precedent for others trying to save wild plants threatened by invasive pests and pathogens." data-reactid="167"></div><figcaption data-reactid="168"><!-- react-text: 169 -->Professor William Powell hopes his team&apos;s research sets a precedent for others trying to save wild plants threatened by invasive pests and pathogens.<!-- /react-text --></figcaption></figure><div data-reactid="170"><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;What we want to do is quickly get their approval too so we can plant up there.

Each agency has a different package of requirements.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s always harder to be the first,&#x201D; Powell says, adding that he hopes this sets a precedent for other researchers trying to save wild plants threatened by invasive pests and pathogens.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">With any intervention into nature, there are unknowns. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s always a risk because it&#x2019;s biology,&#x201D; says Hamelin, the forest pathology researcher.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Horizontal gene transfer, the transmission of DNA between species, is far less common in multicellular organisms like plants than in bacteria, but scientists are discovering more and more instances of it. Powell doesn&#x2019;t believe this is an overwhelming concern, in part because the oxalic acid neutralizing enzyme is found in so many plants, including bananas and strawberries.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">A more pressing scenario, one often encountered by agricultural biotechnologists, is a genetic arms race between the transgenic tree and the fungus. The tree would carry a single gene conferring resistance and takes years to mature. The pathogen produces billions of spores in that time, and each is an opportunity to mutate &#x2014; an &#x201C;unfair advantage,&#x201D; Hamelin notes. In a discussion of the transgenic tree, &#x201C;this issue has to be addressed.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Powell says that his team&#x2019;s approach, which doesn&#x2019;t attack the fungus itself, lessens the selective pressure to beat the tree&#x2019;s gene. The lab is also working with groups that are crossing and back-crossing the Asian and American chestnuts, exploring ways to &#x201C;stack&#x201D; resistance genes &#x2014; a platoon approach.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">UBC&#x2019;s Aitken says Powell is &#x201C;doing great work,&#x201D; in part because his lab has taken pains to keep their work transparent &#x2014; a chance for fruitful dialogue.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;In addition to having great potential for getting American chestnut back out on the landscape and increasing the diversity of species in the forest and providing food for all those creatures that eat chestnuts and all those good things, it also provides us with a good example of one use of genetic modification that isn&#x2019;t tangled up with profit and patent and genetic control of resources,&#x201D; Aitken says.
