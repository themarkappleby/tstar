In the years since, the tide of public opinion has shifted.</p><p></p><p itemprop="articleBody">Research into racially biased policing has deepened and the public&#x2019;s demand, and appreciation, for data of this kind has grown.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">In the U.S., race data has proven instrumental in revealing problems of discriminatory policing. Some also point to the Star&#x2019;s racial profiling investigations as providing the proof of concept that while race-based statistics can be misused to stigmatize vulnerable groups, they can also be a powerful tool to expose and destroy systemic racism.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s not the collection of data; it&#x2019;s the criminalization of data about us that has been the concern,&#x201D; said Anthony Morgan, a community advocate and lawyer.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;We&#x2019;ve come to a place where we see the power and importance of having more data and we are less fearful of the ways in which that data will be manipulated.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Calls for police to start collecting and releasing race-based data that capture police interactions with the public have grown louder.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">With the <a onclick="theStarLinkClick(event, this)" href="https://www.thestar.com/news/crime/2016/06/06/proactive-policing-will-build-trust-cut-costs-minister-says.html">rewriting of Ontario&#x2019;s Police Services Act</a> and the review of the province&#x2019;s police oversight bodies, both of which are expected to be unveiled in the coming weeks, a rare window of opportunity has opened for the province to mandate that police collect data based on race.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">But 28 years after a disastrous community meeting slammed the door on the practice, is Toronto, and the rest of Ontario, ready for this?</p><p itemprop="articleBody"><hr class="stars"></p><p itemprop="articleBody">For all the angst surrounding race data, collecting the information requires just a small act: checking a box, or pushing a button on a touchscreen.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">The cumulative potential of these small acts can be huge.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">For proof, look no further than Oakland, Calif., home to one of the most controversial law enforcement agencies in the U.S.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">A fact about Oakland: if you are a man in this city of roughly 400,000, police are far more likely to stop you if your skin is black.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Another fact: if you are a black man stopped by Oakland police, you are more likely to be searched, arrested and even spoken to harshly. You have a 1-in-4 chance of being handcuffed, even if you&#x2019;re not arrested.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Oakland&#x2019;s black residents know all this because they live it. Now the rest of the world knows it, too, thanks to statistics published by Stanford University researchers hired by the City of Oakland.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">These findings were revealed by the data, reams of it, pulled from 28,119 forms compiled over the course of a year, recording the race of every Oaklander stopped by police on the street or in a car. The Stanford study produced 50 recommendations to help Oakland police fix a culture &#x201C;whereby it&#x2019;s more acceptable to stop, search, handcuff, and arrest African Americans than whites.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Just 33 have been implemented or initiated. More work lies ahead.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">But these important steps would not have been possible if police weren&#x2019;t collecting data based on race.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;The time when police departments would simply say, &#x2018;We&#x2019;re not going to gather any data&#x2019; is probably in the past,&#x201D; said David A. Harris, a law professor with the University of Pittsburgh and an expert on racial profiling.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;When there&#x2019;s no data, nobody can prove anything one way or the other.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">But like many U.S. police services that now collect race-based data, Oakland police had to be forced to do it.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">They were ordered to do so following a high-profile legal settlement with 119 plaintiffs, most of whom were black. The plaintiffs accused four rogue cops of beatings, kidnappings and falsifying evidence. The plaintiffs were ultimately paid nearly $11 million (U.S.) in damages in 2003, the largest settlement in Oakland&#x2019;s history.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Every other police service in California is now required to collect and publicly report the data through a bill passed by the legislature in 2015.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">In Ontario, many advocates pushing for data to be collected believe that police services here, too, will have to be forced to do it.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">It was this kind of data that showed Ottawa police last year that officers were more likely to pull over Middle Eastern and black male drivers in a traffic stop than those who were white, particularly if the drivers were young.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">The <a onclick="theStarLinkClick(event, this)" href="https://www.thestar.com/opinion/commentary/2016/10/27/racism-in-policing-is-about-outcomes-not-intentions-cole.html">two-year data collection project</a> was the result of a settlement between the Ottawa Police Services Board and the Ontario Human Rights Commission following a complaint by Chad Aiken, a young black man alleging racial profiling.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">The Ottawa police response to the data is part of the reason Renu Mandhane, Ontario&#x2019;s chief human rights commissioner, believes the province is in a &#x201C;hopeful moment.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Ten years ago, Mandhane said, the police response would have been more defensive, far more likely to have included claims that the data showed racialized people commit more traffic crime, and outright denials about the possible role of racial profiling.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">But this was not how Ottawa police responded.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;In my conversations with police leadership, many of them have moved beyond questioning whether racial discrimination, or racism, exists,&#x201D; Mandhane said.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Mandhane and the commission, which has been pushing for the collection of race-based police data for more than a decade, are under no illusions that police will collect the data voluntarily.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">As part of the overhaul of the Police Services Act, which has not been revised for 25 years, the commission is <a onclick="theStarLinkClick(event, this)" href="https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2016/05/26/ontario-human-rights-commission-calls-for-big-changes-in-policing.html">urging the province</a> to require police to collect data on identity, including information on race, in all stops of civilians and incidents involving the use of force.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">The commission <a onclick="theStarLinkClick(event, this)" href="https://www.thestar.com/news/crime/2016/12/01/siu-must-release-investigative-reports-human-rights-commission.html">made the same recommendation</a> to Ontario Court of Appeal Justice Michael Tulloch. For the past year, Tulloch and his team have been reviewing police watchdogs, including the Special Investigations Unit, which <a onclick="theStarLinkClick(event, this)" href="https://www.thestar.com/news/crime/2015/08/16/how-many-black-men-have-been-killed-by-toronto-police-we-cant-know.html">does not collect race data</a> in its probes of fatalities, serious injuries and allegations of sexual assault involving police.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Tulloch&#x2019;s report is due at the end of the month, while the changes to police legislation are expected to be unveiled this spring.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">To many, the success of both turns on the question of race-based data.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;I would argue that the revision of the Police Services Act and the Tulloch Review will not have fulfilled their mandate if neither include provisions for the collection, analysis and dissemination of race-based statistics,&#x201D; said Akwasi Owusu-Bempah, an assistant professor of criminology at the University of Toronto and an expert in race and policing.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Morgan, the lawyer and community advocate, adds that race-based data is a vital part of evidence-based policy making in policing and beyond, including measuring the need for reforms to everything from schools and housing to health and prisons.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;It gives us greater access to the levers of both change and accountability.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody"><hr class="stars"></p><p itemprop="articleBody">If recent developments are any indication, Queen&#x2019;s Park appears to be warming to the idea of race-based data.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Last year, in its <a onclick="theStarLinkClick(event, this)" href="https://www.thestar.com/news/queenspark/2016/03/22/province-updates-carding-regulations-for-police.html">new regulations</a> governing carding, the province mandated that police services release annual statistics on things such as the race, sex and age of those stopped. The children and youth minister also vowed that Ontario&#x2019;s 47 children&#x2019;s aid societies would start collecting race data, as part of efforts to reduce the high number of black kids in care.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Earlier this month, the province&#x2019;s anti-racism directorate <a onclick="theStarLinkClick(event, this)" href="https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2017/03/07/ontario-government-unveils-3-year-plan-to-battle-racism.html">announced proposed legislation </a> that, if passed, will require the collection of data on race and ethnicity within several government sectors, including the justice system.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Asked whether the revised Police Services Act will include direction for police to begin collecting data on race, Yasir Naqvi, Ontario&#x2019;s attorney general, said the new law is under development.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;So much of our work is focused on community-based prevention, evidence-based prevention. In order for that to take place appropriately, to develop community-based evolving plans, you need that data,&#x201D; Naqvi said.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">As for Toronto police, spokesperson Meaghan Gray didn&#x2019;t say whether the service or the police chief would support race-based data collection, but pointed to Ontario&#x2019;s new carding regulations, which require the gathering and reporting of this data.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">The province will likely face strong opposition from chiefs and police associations, says former Kingston police chief Bill Closs, who is now retired.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">In 2003, Closs made the unprecedented move to begin collecting race-based data from stops by his officers. The two-year project showed that black people were stopped three times as often as white people. The revelation prompted a tearful apology from Closs.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">The backlash from inside the policing community was swift: the Kingston Police Association attacked the study.

Yet the situation only grows worse by the day.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">So Jordan was, in principle, a necessary jolt to the system, legal observers say. The resulting stay of charges, particularly in the Picard case, has in turn incensed the public, which has pushed politicians into action.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;If victims are mad at anybody, they should not be mad at the courts, they should be mad at governments, which have consistently made business decisions to underfund the system in the expectations that judges will let them off the hook,&#x201D; said lawyer Frank Addario, who represented Ontario&#x2019;s Criminal Lawyers&#x2019; Association as an intervener in the Jordan case.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;All the Supreme Court of Canada has done is say that when you continually violate the constitution, we&#x2019;re obliged to give the defendant a remedy. It&#x2019;s not a reward. It&#x2019;s a remedy for a past violation . . . It&#x2019;s easy to avoid if you don&#x2019;t make the business decision to violate the right to a speedy trial.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">In the aftermath of Jordan, provincial governments have poured millions of dollars into beefing up the justice system. In Ontario, Attorney General Yasir Naqvi announced that <a onclick="theStarLinkClick(event, this)" href="https://www.thestar.com/news/queenspark/2016/12/01/ontario-to-tackle-court-delays-by-hiring-more-judges-prosecutors.html">the government would appoint 13 new judges to the Ontario Court of Justice</a> and 32 new Crown prosecutors, among other changes, though critics say that still falls short of what is needed.</p><p itemprop="articleBody"><a onclick="theStarLinkClick(event, this)" href="https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2017/02/21/ontarios-attorney-general-calls-on-federal-counterpart-to-speed-up-justice-system.html">Naqvi is also pleading</a> with federal Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to fill the 11 judicial vacancies in the under-resourced Superior Court.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">He told the Star that he&#x2019;s hearing more and more stories of it taking much longer now <a onclick="theStarLinkClick(event, this)" href="https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2017/01/23/ontario-lawyers-warn-civil-court-delays-a-worsening-disaster.html">to schedule civil and family matters in Superior Court</a> &#x2014; cases which do not carry the same constitutional right for a trial in a reasonable time.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;All because resources are being diverted to deal with criminal matters in response to Jordan timelines,&#x201D; Naqvi said. &#x201C;The issue has a domino effect. As much as we are focused on the criminal justice system, we also have a responsibility to civil and family law. That&#x2019;s why I feel it&#x2019;s even more imperative that we find an expedited way of filling those vacancies.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Jordan&#x2019;s lawyers, along with the Criminal Lawyers&#x2019; Association and others, had asked the Supreme Court to &#x201C;recalibrate&#x201D; the rather flexible legal analysis around delay, arguing that far too often cases were still going to trial despite having spent years in the system.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">And while the court certainly did proceed to recalibrate, they also came up with their own numbers: 18 and 30.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Therein lies the problem, experts say, not to mention the four Supreme Court judges who did not agree with Moldaver and company. None of the lawyers proposed those numbers. None of the lawyers were asked for submissions on those numbers.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;They invented them,&#x201D; Addario said of the numerical ceilings.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">The majority explained that they reached the new framework after conducting a &#x201C;qualitative review&#x201D; of almost every reported decision on delay from appeal courts in the last 10 years, and many rulings from trial courts.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;By reading these cases with the new framework in mind, we were able to get a rough sense of how the new framework would have played out in some past cases,&#x201D; the majority wrote. &#x201C;Indeed, we note that in the seminal case of Askov, the delay was in the range of 30 months, as it was in Godin some 19 years later, and in both cases, this court found the delays to be unreasonable.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">The now-retired Justice Thomas Cromwell, writing for the minority, which included Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin, pulled no punches in calling out the majority for swooping in with the new numbers without any debate. (The minority also concluded that in Jordan&#x2019;s case, specifically, the delay was unreasonable and they agreed his charges should be stayed.)</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Cromwell said he &#x201C;fundamentally&#x201D; disagreed with the approach of the majority, calling it &#x201C;both unwarranted and unwise.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;Based on the limited evidence in the record, the presumptive time periods proposed by my colleagues are unlikely to improve the pace at which the vast majority of cases move through the system while risking judicial stays in potentially thousands of cases,&#x201D; he wrote.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;One of the themes that appears throughout the court&#x2019;s jurisprudence on the right to be tried within a reasonable time is that reasonableness cannot be judicially defined with precision or captured by a number. The proposed ceilings are deeply inconsistent with this constant in our jurisprudence.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">The focal point of Cromwell&#x2019;s reasons is that determining whether an accused has been tried within a reasonable time is &#x201C;inherently case-specific,&#x201D; and should take into account a balancing of several factors, including society&#x2019;s interests in bringing a case to trial, especially when a very serious offence has been committed.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;If there are exceptionally strong societal interests in the prosecution of a case against an accused which substantially outweigh the societal interest and the interest of the accused person in prompt trials, these can serve as an &#x2018;acceptable basis&#x2019; upon which exceeding the inherent and institutional requirements of a case can be justified,&#x201D; Cromwell wrote.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">The Supreme Court majority noted that the ceiling is not an &#x201C;aspirational target,&#x201D; and that the public should expect that most cases are still resolved before coming close to 18 or 30 months.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">They left the door open to the defence to still argue unreasonable delay even if the ceiling has not been breached, as long as the defence can prove they took &#x201C;meaningful steps that demonstrate a sustained effort to expedite the proceedings&#x201D; and that the case took &#x201C;markedly longer&#x201D; than it should have. But the majority also admitted that stays in such cases would be &#x201C;rare.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Defence lawyers, as well as the Supreme Court minority, took issue with this, as the onus to bring an accused to trial in a reasonable time has always been on the Crown.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s the Crown&#x2019;s obligation, and yet the defence lawyer needs to essentially participate or take a significantly active role in bringing their own client to trial,&#x201D; said Toronto criminal defence lawyer Daniel Brown.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;That wasn&apos;t the law before, it said we can&apos;t forget that it&apos;s the Crown&apos;s duty to bring an accused to trial, and as long as the defence lawyer wasn&#x2019;t standing in the way of that, there wasn&apos;t this obligation imposed on them.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Criminal defence lawyers in Ontario have said the 18-month ceiling in provincial court is too high, saying the average time in the Ontario Court of Justice is closer to the 12-month range.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">As for Superior Court &#x2014; where the seriousness of offences, jury trials and other factors add to the complexity &#x2014; some have voiced concern the 30-month ceiling may be too low.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">While the Supreme Court majority may have said the ceilings are not &#x201C;aspirational targets,&#x201D; that would not appear to be the actual reality in the lower courts post-Jordan, as defence lawyers have spoken of the prosecution and the courts putting off dealing with their cases in a quicker fashion because they&#x2019;re not close to the ceiling.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Brown said the new reality is that an accused person who isn&#x2019;t nearing the ceiling can actually be penalized for taking every step to get to trial as quickly as possible.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;You&#x2019;re the first case to get bumped,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;Because their case is no longer in jeopardy of being delayed, they&#x2019;re easily moved to a new court date, meaning the accused has to re-prepare their case, their life remains on hold, the defence lawyer has to charge an extra fee.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">For example, Brown spoke of a client charged with sexual assault two years ago who was set to go on trial last month, but the case got pushed to August. &#x201C;They said there are other cases that have taken longer than yours,&#x201D; Brown said.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Defence lawyers have also complained of important procedural rights for their clients being bypassed to save time, such as the Crown seeking what are known as &#x201C;preferred indictments&#x201D; to send an accused straight to trial without first having a preliminary hearing.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;My view is that the (Jordan) decision is going to do far more harm than good for accused individuals,&#x201D; said Toronto criminal defence lawyer Sean Robichaud. &#x201C;Protections that accused persons would otherwise enjoy are being sacrificed, or waived under coercive circumstances, to avoid a problem they often did not contribute towards.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">The lasting impact of R v. Jordan may not be known for several years. Appeals of stays of proceedings, such as the Picard murder case, are moving through the courts. One or more of them will likely end up before the Supreme Court, where the majority said that the numbers they imposed may need to be revisited one day.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;I still don&#x2019;t know what to think of it,&#x201D; Gottardi, Jordan&#x2019;s lawyer, told the Star.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;I really do think it took some courage to write it. Whether they&#x2019;re right or wrong, time will be the judge of that. It threw out 20 years of jurisprudence and we need a better way. This might not be a better way, but it&#x2019;s thinking outside the usual box, and courts don&#x2019;t often do that. They get credit for that in my books.&#x201D;</p></div><div class="show-for-medium-only alpha__big-box star-touch-banner__article" data-reactid="199"><div class="alpha__big-box__body" data-reactid="200"><div class="" data-reactid="201"><!-- react-empty: 202 --></div></div></div><!-- react-empty: 203 --><div class="newsletter-box show-for-small-only" data-reactid="204"><div class="newsletter-box__body" data-reactid="205"><div class="newsletter-box__body-content" data-reactid="206"><div data-reactid="207"><span class="resist-font-resizer" data-reactid="208">Delivered daily</span><span class="newsletter-box__heading" data-reactid="209">The Morning Headlines&#xA0;Newsletter</span><div class="clearfix" data-reactid="210"><div class="newsletter-box__input-box" data-reactid="211"><input type="email" value="" placeholder="Enter your email address" aria-label="Your email address" class="" data-reactid="212"></div><button class="button" data-reactid="213">Subscribe</button></div></div></div><p class="newsletter-box__legal" data-reactid="214"><!-- react-text: 215 -->The Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E&#xA0;1E6.

Its storyline embodied Berry&#x2019;s experience as an African-American born into segregation who lived to see &#x201C;his name in lights:&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Deep down Louisiana close to New Orleans</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Way back up in the woods among the evergreens</p><p itemprop="articleBody">There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Where lived a country boy named Johnny B.

I revived the era with a story about a &#x2018;colored boy named Johnny B.

His music became tradition at that point.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Although his music was rooted in the blues, Berry developed a clearer, more accessible singing style geared to a broader audience. He had been deeply influenced by Nat King Cole, the jazz pianist and crooner known for his impeccable diction. </p><p itemprop="articleBody">By the late 1950s, Berry was one of the new music&#x2019;s most prominent stars. He toured with disc jockey Alan Freed&#x2019;s 1957 rock-and-roll revue and appeared in teen-centric movies including <em>Rock, Rock, Rock!</em> (1956) and <em>Go, Johnny, Go!</em> (1959).</p><p itemprop="articleBody"></p><p annotation="note">Despite Berry&#x2019;s charisma, race played a factor in preventing him from achieving Elvis-like levels of commercial success in Hollywood and Las Vegas. He had hits including &#x201C;No Particular Place to Go&#x201D; (1964) and &#x201C;Dear Dad&#x201D; (1965) and appeared in <em>The T.A.M.I. Show</em>, a 1965 concert film with James Brown, the Rolling Stones, the Beach Boys and Marvin Gaye. But Berry was relegated to the oldies circuit by the end of the decade.</p><p></p><p itemprop="articleBody">His 1972 recording, &#x201C;My Ding-A-Ling,&#x201D; a smutty singalong written by New Orleans bandleader Dave Bartholomew, would be his last entry in the charts and his only hit not to come from his own pen.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">In later decades, Berry did not keep a working band together and often relied on promoters to hire his accompanists.</p><p itemprop="articleBody"></p><p annotation="note">An unrehearsed performance as Berry&#x2019;s backup band often became a rite of passage for younger groups.

Hail! Rock &#x2018;n&#x2019; Roll</em>, a documentary and concert film directed by Taylor Hackford and featuring guest performers including Keith Richards, Eric Clapton and Ronstadt.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">At the time, Berry said he was wary of accepting a crown &#x2014; bestowed by critics or peers &#x2014; as a &#x201C;king&#x201D; of rock music.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;What the heck is a king?&#x201D; he told The Washington Post. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m a cog in the wheel.

His father was a carpenter and handyman. The family &#x2014; which included six children &#x2014; lived in the Ville, a middle-class African-American neighbourhood.</p><p itemprop="articleBody"></p><p annotation="note">He was 14 when he began playing guitar and performing at parties, but that was interrupted by a three-year stint in reform school for his role in a bungled armed robbery. After his release, he worked for his father and on an automobile assembly line while studying for a career in hairdressing.</p><p></p><p itemprop="articleBody">On weekends, he sang at the Cosmopolitan Club in East St. Louis, Illinois, with a group led by pianist Johnnie Johnson, who later played on many of Berry&#x2019;s records. </p><p itemprop="articleBody">At the urging of Muddy Waters, Berry took his demo tapes to Chess Records, the Chicago label that specialized in blues and urban rhythm-and-blues. Label owner Leonard Chess was impressed by &#x201C;Ida May,&#x201D; a country-and-western-styled tune, and said he would allow Berry to record it if he would change the name to &#x201C;Maybellene.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">The song&#x2019;s countrified style and Berry&#x2019;s non-bluesy intonation reportedly led many disc jockeys to assume that he was white, and the song&#x2019;s popularity with white record-buyers helped spur his quick rise in the music industry.</p><p itemprop="articleBody"></p><p annotation="note">&#x201C;I was 31,&#x201D; Berry said, &#x201C;and to sell in volume, I knew about that kind of commerce. I wasn&#x2019;t going to stay around the neighbourhood . . . I&#x2019;d rather give everybody in the country a little taste, &#x2019;cause that&#x2019;s far more in return than selling out in the neighborhood.&#x201D;</p><p></p><p itemprop="articleBody">His outspokenness was not always appreciated by music purists, but his savvy about the unsavory business practices of the day &#x2014; giving co-writing credits to deejays, such as Alan Freed, in exchange for frequent airplay &#x2014; propelled his career forward.</p><p itemprop="articleBody"></p><p annotation="note">But it was nearly derailed in 1959, when he was arrested on a federal charge of taking a 14-year-old girl across state lines for immoral purposes. He claimed that he didn&#x2019;t know the girl&#x2019;s age and had hired her to work as a hat-check girl in his nightclub. Berry was convicted but granted an appeal on the basis of racist remarks made by the judge. A second trial also ended in a conviction. Berry eventually served 18 months of a three-year sentence and paid a $10,000 fine.</p><p></p><p itemprop="articleBody">He was released in 1963, soon to find his career overtaken by a second wave of rockers and the so-called British invasion of bands, such as the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. He rebounded quickly in the music scene but at times continued to be drawn into the headlines by legal troubles.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">In 1979, he served four months in Lompoc Federal Prison in California for tax evasion. In his 1987 memoir, he joked about his various prison terms: &#x201C;My next fall is due around year end of 1996, so I have a while yet.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">It would come sooner. In 1989, Hosana Huck, a cook in Berry&#x2019;s St. Louis restaurant, the Southern Air, sued him, claiming that he secretly videotaped her and other women in the establishment&#x2019;s restroom. Huck&#x2019;s suit was followed by a class-action suit by other unnamed women. Berry denied any wrongdoing but settled out of court in 1995 for $1.5 million.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">In 1948, Berry married Themetta Suggs, known as Toddy. Information on survivors was not immediately available.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Berry received the top honours of his profession, including a Grammy Award for lifetime achievement in 1984 and the Kennedy Center Honors in 2000.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">In later years, when Berry reflected on his age, he always made it clear that he intended to keep rocking as long as he lived.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;Elvis&#x2019; songs will always be there, and I hope mine will be after I&#x2019;m gone,&#x201D; he told the Los Angeles Times in 2002. &#x201C;But you can&#x2019;t compare that, because he&#x2019;s gone and I&#x2019;m not!&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">On his 90th birthday last year, Berry disclosed that he would release <a onclick="theStarLinkClick(event, this)" href="https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/music/2016/10/18/chuck-berry-announces-surprise-album-on-his-90th-birthday.html">his first new album in 38 years in 2017</a>, titled simply: <em>Chuck</em>.

In some parts, one in four trees was an American chestnut. The trees were a refuge for hundreds of species and a thrumming industry: its wood was so hardy that chestnut fences still stake Ontario fields.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Then, in less than 50 years, the trees were gone. An exotic blight, accidentally carried over on an Asian chestnut variety, began infecting American chestnuts as the 20th century dawned. By 1950, up to four billion trees had died, two million of them in Ontario, wiping out 99.9 per cent of the species and radically reshaping the forests it once dominated.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Now, a century later, an American research team has an equally unprecedented solution: a genetically modified American chestnut.

The American species, however, bore no natural resistance.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">It&#x2019;s hard to overstate the consequences of the loss of the American chestnut, ecologically, commercially and culturally. The trees dominated the forest canopy, produced massive volumes of nuts, and shed a particularly protein-rich leaf litter, providing shelter and nourishment for other species.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">When the tree was wiped out, multiple species of insects went extinct almost immediately, and many other animals, from deer to bears to wild turkeys, were impacted. Some scientists wonder whether the loss of the American chestnut contributed to the extinction of the passenger pigeon, since the soaring, 35-metre-high trees provided roosts for birds and both died out around the same time.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">As commercial timber, Americans &#x201C;called it the cradle to grave wood, since almost all everyday items were made of chestnut,&#x201D; says Ron Casier, chair of the Canadian Chestnut Council, a conservation group. Its supreme rot resistance made it a favourite for log cabins, flooring, and railroad ties. Nuts from the tree were a common food, as North American holiday traditions still suggest.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">In a single human generation, a geological wink, the tree disappeared.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;That&#x2019;s pretty much the most important wipeout of a species by a pathogen &#x2014; I can&#x2019;t think of anything else on that scale,&#x201D; says Richard Hamelin, a professor of forest pathology at the University of British Columbia.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Because the tree is so &#x201C;iconic,&#x201D; says Hamelin, &#x201C;ever since I did my PhD &#x2014; and before that, of course &#x2014; people have been interested in its restoration.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">The fungus creates cankers that girdle the trunk and branches, but it does not affect the roots. Decades after the trees died off, stump rings still pock the countryside, sending up shoots that then become infected and die. This cycle gives researchers hope &#x2014; and more importantly, if the trees survive long enough to flower, seeds.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">For decades, researchers have been trying to crossbreed the naturally resistant Asian chestnut species with the American. But the offspring of these trees are smaller hybrids, so the ones with blight resistance are then selected and &#x201C;back-crossed&#x201D; with another American chestnut tree to create offspring that are genetically truer to the endangered species.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Through enough generations of crossing and back-crossing, a tree that is blight-resistant and mostly American chestnut would be created. But the tree takes years to reach sexual maturity, so this research has been painstakingly slow, and has not yet produced trees with high levels of resistance.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Researchers also tried a tactic called hypovirulence, which uses a virus to infect the fungus, making it less potent. It didn&#x2019;t pan out, but it gave researchers a clue. The weaker strains of fungus produced less of a substance called oxalic acid &#x2014; a hint that this was the fungus&#x2019; weapon.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Powell and his colleagues noted that wheat and other grasses carry a gene that produces an enzyme that defangs oxalic acid, transforming it into two harmless byproducts, carbon dioxide and hydrogen peroxide. By splicing this gene into the American chestnut genome, the SUNY-ESF team theorized they could create a blight-resistant tree.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">It sounds simple. It took Powell and his colleagues 27 years. &#x201C;We started off when no one was doing this stuff,&#x201D; he says.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">The lab planted their first transgenic American chestnut trees in an outdoor research plot in 2006, ones with &#x201C;intermediate&#x201D; levels of blight resistance. Recent tests have shown even better defences, matching or surpassing the Asian trees; these highly resistant trees will be planted in the New York Botanical Garden this year.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">As early as summer, Powell and his team will begin applying to U.S. federal agencies for approval to distribute the plant to the public. As soon as those reviews are initiated, they will reformat their documents and submit to Environment Canada and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.</p></div><figure class="image" data-reactid="165"><div class="image__body " data-reactid="166"><img src="https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/news/world/2017/03/18/science-finds-a-way-to-bring-back-the-american-chestnut-tree/williampowell.jpg.size.custom.crop.850x624.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 850px) 850px, 100vw" srcset="https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/news/world/2017/03/18/science-finds-a-way-to-bring-back-the-american-chestnut-tree/williampowell.jpg.size.custom.crop.320x234.jpg 320w, https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/news/world/2017/03/18/science-finds-a-way-to-bring-back-the-american-chestnut-tree/williampowell.jpg.size.custom.crop.480x352.jpg 480w, https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/news/world/2017/03/18/science-finds-a-way-to-bring-back-the-american-chestnut-tree/williampowell.jpg.size.custom.crop.640x469.jpg 640w, https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/news/world/2017/03/18/science-finds-a-way-to-bring-back-the-american-chestnut-tree/williampowell.jpg.size.custom.crop.850x624.jpg 850w" alt="Professor William Powell hopes his team&apos;s research sets a precedent for others trying to save wild plants threatened by invasive pests and pathogens." data-reactid="167"></div><figcaption data-reactid="168"><!-- react-text: 169 -->Professor William Powell hopes his team&apos;s research sets a precedent for others trying to save wild plants threatened by invasive pests and pathogens.<!-- /react-text --></figcaption></figure><div data-reactid="170"><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;What we want to do is quickly get their approval too so we can plant up there.

Each agency has a different package of requirements.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s always harder to be the first,&#x201D; Powell says, adding that he hopes this sets a precedent for other researchers trying to save wild plants threatened by invasive pests and pathogens.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">With any intervention into nature, there are unknowns. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s always a risk because it&#x2019;s biology,&#x201D; says Hamelin, the forest pathology researcher.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Horizontal gene transfer, the transmission of DNA between species, is far less common in multicellular organisms like plants than in bacteria, but scientists are discovering more and more instances of it. Powell doesn&#x2019;t believe this is an overwhelming concern, in part because the oxalic acid neutralizing enzyme is found in so many plants, including bananas and strawberries.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">A more pressing scenario, one often encountered by agricultural biotechnologists, is a genetic arms race between the transgenic tree and the fungus. The tree would carry a single gene conferring resistance and takes years to mature. The pathogen produces billions of spores in that time, and each is an opportunity to mutate &#x2014; an &#x201C;unfair advantage,&#x201D; Hamelin notes. In a discussion of the transgenic tree, &#x201C;this issue has to be addressed.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Powell says that his team&#x2019;s approach, which doesn&#x2019;t attack the fungus itself, lessens the selective pressure to beat the tree&#x2019;s gene. The lab is also working with groups that are crossing and back-crossing the Asian and American chestnuts, exploring ways to &#x201C;stack&#x201D; resistance genes &#x2014; a platoon approach.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">UBC&#x2019;s Aitken says Powell is &#x201C;doing great work,&#x201D; in part because his lab has taken pains to keep their work transparent &#x2014; a chance for fruitful dialogue.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;In addition to having great potential for getting American chestnut back out on the landscape and increasing the diversity of species in the forest and providing food for all those creatures that eat chestnuts and all those good things, it also provides us with a good example of one use of genetic modification that isn&#x2019;t tangled up with profit and patent and genetic control of resources,&#x201D; Aitken says. In a survey that was part of a larger project Aitken led, researchers found that approximately half of respondents would accept planting genetically modified seedlings as a strategy to help western Canada&#x2019;s forests adapt to climate change.</p></div><figure class="image" data-reactid="171"><div class="image__body " data-reactid="172"><img src="https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/news/world/2017/03/18/science-finds-a-way-to-bring-back-the-american-chestnut-tree/chestnut-planting.jpg.size.custom.crop.488x650.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 488px) 488px, 100vw" srcset="https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/news/world/2017/03/18/science-finds-a-way-to-bring-back-the-american-chestnut-tree/chestnut-planting.jpg.size.custom.crop.320x426.jpg 320w, https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/news/world/2017/03/18/science-finds-a-way-to-bring-back-the-american-chestnut-tree/chestnut-planting.jpg.size.custom.crop.488x650.jpg 488w" alt="Volunteers are shown how to plant American chestnut trees in a field test plots." data-reactid="173"></div><figcaption data-reactid="174"><!-- react-text: 175 -->Volunteers are shown how to plant American chestnut trees in a field test plots.<!-- /react-text --><span class="image__credit" data-reactid="176"><!-- react-text: 177 -->&#xA0;&#xA0;(<!-- /react-text --><span class="image__credit__source" data-reactid="178"><!-- react-text: 179 -->Bill Powell<!-- /react-text --></span><!-- react-text: 180 -->)<!-- /react-text --><!-- react-text: 181 -->&#xA0;&#xA0;<!-- /react-text --></span></figcaption></figure><div data-reactid="182"><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;Really, the number of American chestnuts they&#x2019;re going to have if they don&#x2019;t do this is zero.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Hamelin says the greater concern in the forestry research community is not that the approach is risky, but that it will fail because the pathogen will adapt.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;Among the people who care about chestnuts and the people who care about trees and forest protection, I think most people, because of the fact that it&#x2019;s an endangered species decimated by a foreign invader, that justifies going to this level.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Others have reservations.

Perhaps a four-leaf clover hidden beneath the blade tape? A pre-game kiss of the Blarney Stone or some such? Or that popular teenaged go-to, Lucky Charms for all three meals?</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Nah. Matthews, the 19-year-old rookie with zero Irish blood but 100 per cent buy-in on hockey&#x2019;s locker-room lingo, obviously just played right and went hard to the dirty areas. Connecting with linemate William Nylander on a nifty give-and-go, Matthews blew by Brent Seabrook en route to the goal mouth before steering an artful tip-in past Corey Crawford. And with that, Matthews&#x2019;s much-talked-about scoring drought was over.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Not that the statistical slowdown did the young man&#x2019;s numbers irreparable damage. The league lead for even-strength goals stood at 26 coming into Saturday. This was Matthews&#x2019; 27th. </p><p itemprop="articleBody">With hockey&#x2019;s gold-standard franchise making its lone annual trip to the Air Canada Centre, the Leafs couldn&#x2019;t parlay Matthews&#x2019; lull-buster into the full two points, falling 2-1 on Ryan Hartman&#x2019;s goal with 17 seconds remaining in overtime. But they did stare down the best team in the West &#x2014; and the hottest team in hockey, now winners of 11 of 12 &#x2014; and refrain from flinching.</p></div><div class="show-for-small-only alpha__big-box " data-reactid="157"><div class="article-continued" data-reactid="158"><div class="article-continued__heading" data-reactid="159">Article Continued Below</div></div><div class="alpha__big-box__body" data-reactid="160"><div class="big-box" data-reactid="161"><!-- react-empty: 162 --></div></div></div><div data-reactid="163"><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;That&#x2019;s a huge point for us,&#x201D; Babcock said. &#x201C;An absolutely huge point.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">It certainly was a fun-to-watch contest, thanks in part to a riveting 3-on-3 extra period that saw the clubs trade chances for nearly the full five minutes, not to mention a giddier-than-usual atmosphere on Bay Street perhaps thanks to the waving of the souvenir green towels and the quaffing of the cheaper-than-typical beer ($6 tallboys on offer, apparently also in tribute to the team&#x2019;s long-ago Irish roots).</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;Drinking night,&#x201D; was how one MLSE staffer described it.</p></div><div id="fsk_splitbox" data-reactid="164"></div><!-- react-empty: 165 --><div data-reactid="166"><p itemprop="articleBody">It wasn&#x2019;t &#x201C;drinking from the Cup&#x201D; night, although you could have got the idea that some in Leafland were nearly preparing their lips for the long-awaited sip given the repeated comparisons between this year&#x2019;s Leafs team and the 2008-09 Blackhawks, one of which was made by Chicago coach Joel Quenneville and repeated by Babcock, who told the media the Blackhawks coach had told him on Saturday, &#x201C;you remind us of nine years ago.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;Well, you hope there&#x2019;re similarities,&#x201D; Babcock said. </p><p itemprop="articleBody">Certainly there are. It&#x2019;s easy enough to look at Matthews and Mitch Marner and see younger versions of Toews and Kane. But those 2008-09 Blackhawks, it&#x2019;s important to remember, went to the Western Conference final in the sophomore season of the Toews-Kane era. A year later they were hoisting their first of three Stanley Cups. And they were doing it because they also had a roster stacked with talent around Toews and Kane. They had all-world defenceman Duncan Keith. They had the veteran skill of Marian Hossa (out last night with a lower-body injury). They also had a long list of superior talents who eventually ended up being too good (i.e. too expensive) to keep, among them Patrick Sharp, Dustin Byfuglien, Andrew Ladd and Martin Havlat.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">That&#x2019;s depth the Leafs can&#x2019;t yet claim, which might have explained why on Saturday, as much as Quenneville paid his tribute, Toews didn&#x2019;t exactly anoint them hockey&#x2019;s next great gift.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;Obviously several other teams in the league they&#x2019;re comparable to,&#x201D; Toews told reporters. &#x201C;But I think they&#x2019;re one of those teams that are pretty exciting to watch with their young guys.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">The Blackhawks, to be more specific, seemed excited to shut down Toronto&#x2019;s rookies; such is one of the many strengths of Chicago&#x2019;s incredible run of success. (&#x201C;Everybody talks about Chicago and how well they scored . . . yeah, but they play defence,&#x201D; Babcock marvelled). And such is the nature of game-planning as games tighten in the late-season stretch. </p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;Every team&#x2019;s going to be talking about (shutting down Matthews). Who are we talking about in pre-game skate?&#x201D; said Leafs defenceman Connor Carrick after Saturday&#x2019;s morning skate, listing off Kane, Toews and Artemi Panarin. &#x201C;You talk about those guys, playing those guys hard. And that&#x2019;s what other teams are saying about us, &#x2018;We&#x2019;ll make someone else beat us, but we&#x2019;re going to make sure we shut down 34.&#x2019; &#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Maybe that explains, in part, why Matthews&#x2019;s recent run of play has been unlike anything we&#x2019;ve seen from him to this point. His recent lull is far different than, say, his 13-game goal-less run that began in late October. During that dry spell Matthews had been the team&#x2019;s best possession forward as measured by his 53% Corsi rate. He also averaged nearly four shots on goal. So he wasn&#x2019;t scoring. But he was a force in the offensive zone. </p><p itemprop="articleBody">In the seven games previous to Saturday, he&#x2019;d been the team&#x2019;s worst possession player with a 42% Corsi. (On Saturday he was second-worst at 39%). And he simply hadn&#x2019;t been the offensive threat we&#x2019;d come to know. The guy who averaged nearly four shots on goal a game October through December was averaging about two shots on goal a game. (On Saturday he had three). And it&#x2019;s not as though Babcock hadn&#x2019;t been trying to jolt the rookie&#x2019;s offence. Matthews had started shifts in the offensive zone 78% of the time during that seven-game lull.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Still, there&#x2019;s an upside to such a struggle, and maybe it explains how the Leafs had won four of their previous five games with Matthews as a less-than-optimal performer.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">The attention Matthews commands from other teams &#x201C;frees up other lines,&#x201D; said Carrick, who partook in Saturday&#x2019;s morning skate and is expected back in the lineup soon. </p><p itemprop="articleBody">That&#x2019;s one of the reasons the Leafs&#x2019; brain trust had been hoping for meaningful games in the latter half of March and beyond. You don&#x2019;t take an opposing team&#x2019;s best shot if you&#x2019;re a lottery-bound pretender. And even the best franchises can&#x2019;t simply coast until the Stanley Cup tournament commences. As Toews said of his own team: &#x201C;They haven&#x2019;t been easy games. For us it&#x2019;s the time of year where you&#x2019;ve got to push yourself to find a way to get your body ready to play every game.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">That the Leafs could get an up-close glimpse of what that kind of readiness looks like and hang tough until the end &#x2014; well, there was value in that, even if it didn&#x2019;t come with the full two points attached. </p></div><div class="show-for-medium-only alpha__big-box star-touch-banner__article" data-reactid="167"><div class="alpha__big-box__body" data-reactid="168"><div class="" data-reactid="169"><!-- react-empty: 170 --></div></div></div><!-- react-empty: 171 --><div class="newsletter-box show-for-small-only" data-reactid="172"><div class="newsletter-box__body" data-reactid="173"><div class="newsletter-box__body-content" data-reactid="174"><div data-reactid="175"><span class="resist-font-resizer" data-reactid="176">Delivered daily</span><span class="newsletter-box__heading" data-reactid="177">The Morning Headlines&#xA0;Newsletter</span><div class="clearfix" data-reactid="178"><div class="newsletter-box__input-box" data-reactid="179"><input type="email" value="" placeholder="Enter your email address" aria-label="Your email address" class="" data-reactid="180"></div><button class="button" data-reactid="181">Subscribe</button></div></div></div><p class="newsletter-box__legal" data-reactid="182"><!-- react-text: 183 -->The Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E&#xA0;1E6.
