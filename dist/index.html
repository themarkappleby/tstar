He pointed to white senators Pamela Wallin and Mike Duffy, who he said have engaged in improper conduct and have not been forced to resign or been expelled.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">When reached by the Star via Twitter Sunday evening Pieters said he was &#x201C;not doing any more interviews on Senator Don Meredith&#x2019;s case.&#x201D; </p><p itemprop="articleBody">In his interview with <em>Power Play</em>, he defended his client&#x2019;s relationship with the teenager, known only as Ms. M, who was 16 when it began.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;Nothing improper happened,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;It takes two to tango.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Pieters said that the young woman was above the age to legally consent to having sex.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;A teenager or a person who is . . . able to consent is able to have sexual relationships. I mean, in some cultures people marry at 12. You have very old men marrying people at 12. So I don&#x2019;t buy this thing about power and about protecting and all that sort of stuff,&#x201D; he said.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">The relationship between Meredith and the teenage girl began in 2013 when Meredith, 48 at the time and a Pentecostal pastor from the GTA, met the then 16-year-old at a church event. Over a two-year period it progressed from flirtatious chats over Skype and Viber to sexually explicit live videos during which Meredith would masturbate while the woman took off her clothing, to intimate sexual relations that included fondling. They had sexual intercourse before and after the woman turned 18.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">At the same time, Meredith, a married father of two, was suggesting he could help the woman further her career. He was also speaking with her parents about potential business arrangements and to her older sister about a non-profit initiative.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">In her March 9 report, Senate Ethics Officer Lyse Ricard said Meredith failed to uphold &#x201C;the highest standards of dignity&#x201D; of the Canadian Senate. Meredith, the report states, &#x201C;drew upon the weight, prestige and notability of his office, as well as his relative position of power as a much older adult to lure or attract Ms. M, a teenager who by virtue of her age was necessarily vulnerable.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Pieters, who called Meredith&#x2019;s behaviour &#x201C;completely becoming of a senator,&#x201D; also suggested that the young woman may have had other motives when she told her story to the Star. </p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know whether that was in a bid to distort him or what that was,&#x201D; Pieters said, adding.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;This was not something that he was doing something in the bushes or he was doing something on the street. It was in the privacy of his room and her room.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Meredith, who was kicked out of the conservative caucus by Stephen Harper after the allegations first surfaced and is now an independent senator, is facing a separate investigation into allegations of workplace harassment by former staff. Ottawa police began a <a onclick="theStarLinkClick(event, this)" href="https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2016/02/04/sen-don-meredith-wont-face-criminal-charges-over-relationship-with-woman.html">criminal probe</a> but Ms. M decided not to proceed because, she said, police would not guarantee her identity would be kept confidential.

The evidence when properly assessed proves my innocence,&#x201D; Estrada said Feb. 18 in an email to the Star.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">And while the tribunal members concluded that both Mitrovich and Estrada were unreliable in their testimony, they faulted Estrada for not removing himself from the confrontation, citing the physical imbalance between the two.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">A Mountie since 2005, Estrada went to the RCMP&#x2019;s training division in Saskatchewan and worked in Manitoba and, more recently, at the force&#x2019;s Toronto Airport Detachment, the tribunal heard. The tribunal hearing covered the time he was assigned to the RCMP division that includes the airport detachment.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">The disciplinary action began after a friend of Mitrovich&#x2019;s contacted an RCMP officer in August 2012 and said that a member of the force had been arrested in Croatia. The officer was eventually identified as Estrada. He returned to Canada a few days after his arrest, the disciplinary hearing document said.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Knopp, chair of the disciplinary board, said anyone reading the electronic messages exchanged between the two before the Croatia trip &#x201C;would come to the conclusion that the two lovers were anticipating a tryst.&#x201D; But the trip did not go as planned, and Knopp said Estrada was hurt when Mitrovich was uninterested and brought a boyfriend to her condo that day in August. Mitrovich testified that she had earlier asked Estrada to leave and the beating took place when the officer returned.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">At the time, Estrada also damaged two of Mitrovich&#x2019;s cellphones and stole $900 from her condominium, the board found. The theft and damage are what led to Estrada&#x2019;s charges in Croatia, the disciplinary notice said.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;No one can tell you anything, Const. Estrada. You refused to heed sensible warnings from important people to stay away from this woman,&#x201D; Knopp said as he read out the sanction ruling at the tribunal.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Estrada and Mitrovich met in 2008 at the massage parlour where she worked, and moved in together in 2009, Estrada told the tribunal. They broke up shortly after, but would reconnect and have sex several times, according to Estrada.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">By the summer of 2012, the relationship was strictly platonic, Estrada said.

In other words, just how long should it take to bring an accused to trial?</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;I said, &#x2018;Having thought about it for two minutes, it&#x2019;s probably better than what we have right now,&#x2019;

It depends on who you ask.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Along with staying the charges against Jordan, the majority went further and completely revamped the legal framework that guides judges in deciding if a person has been tried within a reasonable time.</p></div><div id="fsk_splitbox" data-reactid="196"></div><!-- react-empty: 197 --><div data-reactid="198"><p itemprop="articleBody">They implemented new so-called &#x201C;numerical ceilings&#x201D; after calling out what they described as a &#x201C;culture of complacency&#x201D; in the Canadian justice system.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">The five judges found that the period between an accused person&#x2019;s arrest and the anticipated conclusion of their trial in provincial court should not exceed 18 months, and should not go over 30 months in Superior Court, which handles the most serious crimes such as murder.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Once those ceilings have been breached, the delay is considered &#x201C;presumptively unreasonable&#x201D; and the case is tossed unless the Crown can prove there are exceptional circumstances, such as the complexity of the case.

Yet the situation only grows worse by the day.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">So Jordan was, in principle, a necessary jolt to the system, legal observers say. The resulting stay of charges, particularly in the Picard case, has in turn incensed the public, which has pushed politicians into action.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;If victims are mad at anybody, they should not be mad at the courts, they should be mad at governments, which have consistently made business decisions to underfund the system in the expectations that judges will let them off the hook,&#x201D; said lawyer Frank Addario, who represented Ontario&#x2019;s Criminal Lawyers&#x2019; Association as an intervener in the Jordan case.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;All the Supreme Court of Canada has done is say that when you continually violate the constitution, we&#x2019;re obliged to give the defendant a remedy. It&#x2019;s not a reward. It&#x2019;s a remedy for a past violation . . . It&#x2019;s easy to avoid if you don&#x2019;t make the business decision to violate the right to a speedy trial.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">In the aftermath of Jordan, provincial governments have poured millions of dollars into beefing up the justice system. In Ontario, Attorney General Yasir Naqvi announced that <a onclick="theStarLinkClick(event, this)" href="https://www.thestar.com/news/queenspark/2016/12/01/ontario-to-tackle-court-delays-by-hiring-more-judges-prosecutors.html">the government would appoint 13 new judges to the Ontario Court of Justice</a> and 32 new Crown prosecutors, among other changes, though critics say that still falls short of what is needed.</p><p itemprop="articleBody"><a onclick="theStarLinkClick(event, this)" href="https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2017/02/21/ontarios-attorney-general-calls-on-federal-counterpart-to-speed-up-justice-system.html">Naqvi is also pleading</a> with federal Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to fill the 11 judicial vacancies in the under-resourced Superior Court.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">He told the Star that he&#x2019;s hearing more and more stories of it taking much longer now <a onclick="theStarLinkClick(event, this)" href="https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2017/01/23/ontario-lawyers-warn-civil-court-delays-a-worsening-disaster.html">to schedule civil and family matters in Superior Court</a> &#x2014; cases which do not carry the same constitutional right for a trial in a reasonable time.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;All because resources are being diverted to deal with criminal matters in response to Jordan timelines,&#x201D; Naqvi said. &#x201C;The issue has a domino effect. As much as we are focused on the criminal justice system, we also have a responsibility to civil and family law. That&#x2019;s why I feel it&#x2019;s even more imperative that we find an expedited way of filling those vacancies.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Jordan&#x2019;s lawyers, along with the Criminal Lawyers&#x2019; Association and others, had asked the Supreme Court to &#x201C;recalibrate&#x201D; the rather flexible legal analysis around delay, arguing that far too often cases were still going to trial despite having spent years in the system.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">And while the court certainly did proceed to recalibrate, they also came up with their own numbers: 18 and 30.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Therein lies the problem, experts say, not to mention the four Supreme Court judges who did not agree with Moldaver and company. None of the lawyers proposed those numbers. None of the lawyers were asked for submissions on those numbers.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;They invented them,&#x201D; Addario said of the numerical ceilings.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">The majority explained that they reached the new framework after conducting a &#x201C;qualitative review&#x201D; of almost every reported decision on delay from appeal courts in the last 10 years, and many rulings from trial courts.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;By reading these cases with the new framework in mind, we were able to get a rough sense of how the new framework would have played out in some past cases,&#x201D; the majority wrote. &#x201C;Indeed, we note that in the seminal case of Askov, the delay was in the range of 30 months, as it was in Godin some 19 years later, and in both cases, this court found the delays to be unreasonable.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">The now-retired Justice Thomas Cromwell, writing for the minority, which included Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin, pulled no punches in calling out the majority for swooping in with the new numbers without any debate. (The minority also concluded that in Jordan&#x2019;s case, specifically, the delay was unreasonable and they agreed his charges should be stayed.)</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Cromwell said he &#x201C;fundamentally&#x201D; disagreed with the approach of the majority, calling it &#x201C;both unwarranted and unwise.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;Based on the limited evidence in the record, the presumptive time periods proposed by my colleagues are unlikely to improve the pace at which the vast majority of cases move through the system while risking judicial stays in potentially thousands of cases,&#x201D; he wrote.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;One of the themes that appears throughout the court&#x2019;s jurisprudence on the right to be tried within a reasonable time is that reasonableness cannot be judicially defined with precision or captured by a number. The proposed ceilings are deeply inconsistent with this constant in our jurisprudence.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">The focal point of Cromwell&#x2019;s reasons is that determining whether an accused has been tried within a reasonable time is &#x201C;inherently case-specific,&#x201D; and should take into account a balancing of several factors, including society&#x2019;s interests in bringing a case to trial, especially when a very serious offence has been committed.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;If there are exceptionally strong societal interests in the prosecution of a case against an accused which substantially outweigh the societal interest and the interest of the accused person in prompt trials, these can serve as an &#x2018;acceptable basis&#x2019; upon which exceeding the inherent and institutional requirements of a case can be justified,&#x201D; Cromwell wrote.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">The Supreme Court majority noted that the ceiling is not an &#x201C;aspirational target,&#x201D; and that the public should expect that most cases are still resolved before coming close to 18 or 30 months.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">They left the door open to the defence to still argue unreasonable delay even if the ceiling has not been breached, as long as the defence can prove they took &#x201C;meaningful steps that demonstrate a sustained effort to expedite the proceedings&#x201D; and that the case took &#x201C;markedly longer&#x201D; than it should have. But the majority also admitted that stays in such cases would be &#x201C;rare.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Defence lawyers, as well as the Supreme Court minority, took issue with this, as the onus to bring an accused to trial in a reasonable time has always been on the Crown.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s the Crown&#x2019;s obligation, and yet the defence lawyer needs to essentially participate or take a significantly active role in bringing their own client to trial,&#x201D; said Toronto criminal defence lawyer Daniel Brown.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;That wasn&apos;t the law before, it said we can&apos;t forget that it&apos;s the Crown&apos;s duty to bring an accused to trial, and as long as the defence lawyer wasn&#x2019;t standing in the way of that, there wasn&apos;t this obligation imposed on them.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Criminal defence lawyers in Ontario have said the 18-month ceiling in provincial court is too high, saying the average time in the Ontario Court of Justice is closer to the 12-month range.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">As for Superior Court &#x2014; where the seriousness of offences, jury trials and other factors add to the complexity &#x2014; some have voiced concern the 30-month ceiling may be too low.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">While the Supreme Court majority may have said the ceilings are not &#x201C;aspirational targets,&#x201D; that would not appear to be the actual reality in the lower courts post-Jordan, as defence lawyers have spoken of the prosecution and the courts putting off dealing with their cases in a quicker fashion because they&#x2019;re not close to the ceiling.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Brown said the new reality is that an accused person who isn&#x2019;t nearing the ceiling can actually be penalized for taking every step to get to trial as quickly as possible.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;You&#x2019;re the first case to get bumped,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;Because their case is no longer in jeopardy of being delayed, they&#x2019;re easily moved to a new court date, meaning the accused has to re-prepare their case, their life remains on hold, the defence lawyer has to charge an extra fee.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">For example, Brown spoke of a client charged with sexual assault two years ago who was set to go on trial last month, but the case got pushed to August. &#x201C;They said there are other cases that have taken longer than yours,&#x201D; Brown said.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Defence lawyers have also complained of important procedural rights for their clients being bypassed to save time, such as the Crown seeking what are known as &#x201C;preferred indictments&#x201D; to send an accused straight to trial without first having a preliminary hearing.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;My view is that the (Jordan) decision is going to do far more harm than good for accused individuals,&#x201D; said Toronto criminal defence lawyer Sean Robichaud. &#x201C;Protections that accused persons would otherwise enjoy are being sacrificed, or waived under coercive circumstances, to avoid a problem they often did not contribute towards.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">The lasting impact of R v. Jordan may not be known for several years. Appeals of stays of proceedings, such as the Picard murder case, are moving through the courts. One or more of them will likely end up before the Supreme Court, where the majority said that the numbers they imposed may need to be revisited one day.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;I still don&#x2019;t know what to think of it,&#x201D; Gottardi, Jordan&#x2019;s lawyer, told the Star.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;I really do think it took some courage to write it. Whether they&#x2019;re right or wrong, time will be the judge of that. It threw out 20 years of jurisprudence and we need a better way. This might not be a better way, but it&#x2019;s thinking outside the usual box, and courts don&#x2019;t often do that. They get credit for that in my books.&#x201D;</p></div><div class="show-for-medium-only alpha__big-box star-touch-banner__article" data-reactid="199"><div class="alpha__big-box__body" data-reactid="200"><div class="" data-reactid="201"><!-- react-empty: 202 --></div></div></div><!-- react-empty: 203 --><div class="newsletter-box show-for-small-only" data-reactid="204"><div class="newsletter-box__body" data-reactid="205"><div class="newsletter-box__body-content" data-reactid="206"><div data-reactid="207"><span class="resist-font-resizer" data-reactid="208">Delivered daily</span><span class="newsletter-box__heading" data-reactid="209">The Morning Headlines&#xA0;Newsletter</span><div class="clearfix" data-reactid="210"><div class="newsletter-box__input-box" data-reactid="211"><input type="email" value="" placeholder="Enter your email address" aria-label="Your email address" class="" data-reactid="212"></div><button class="button" data-reactid="213">Subscribe</button></div></div></div><p class="newsletter-box__legal" data-reactid="214"><!-- react-text: 215 -->The Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E&#xA0;1E6.

After Bloomberg published a video on Feb. 28 showing Kalanick berating an Uber driver, he said he would seek &#x201C;leadership help&#x201D; and was planning to hire a chief operating officer. The plan was viewed internally as an effective demotion for Jones, who was hired last year as president of ride-sharing and second in command, a person familiar with the matter said.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">In an email to staff on Sunday, Kalanick said Jones &#x201C;made an important impact on the company&#x201D; during his six months there. &#x201C;After we announced our intention to hire a COO, Jeff came to the tough decision that he doesn&#x2019;t see his future at Uber,&#x201D; Kalanick wrote, according to a copy of the email obtained by Bloomberg.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Jones decided to leave because the long string of controversies are not what he signed on for when he left his post as chief marketing officer at Target Corp., according to Recode, which reported his departure earlier Sunday.

A 2007 policy effectively overturned the ban, allowing police officers to make a request to collect and analyze race or ethnicity data.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">According to Toronto police, not a single request has been made, though the force conducted an internal analysis of race in the context of carding, referenced in a secret report later <a onclick="theStarLinkClick(event, this)" href="https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2015/05/26/toronto-police-chief-mark-saunders-secret-carding-report.html">obtained by the Star</a>.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Today, race data is only mandatorily collected and reported by Toronto police in the context of the police practice of carding. The rule to publicly report this only came into effect on Jan. 1.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Nearly three decades after that 1989 meeting, the controversy that engulfed Fantino&#x2019;s inflammatory comments is still giving off heat.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;Race-based statistics&#x201D; became politically radioactive. Many attempts to push for race data collection have failed.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;It was a hot potato,&#x201D; said Barbara Hall, Toronto mayor from 1994 to 1997 and a former Ontario human rights commissioner.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;People didn&#x2019;t want to go there.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody"></p><p annotation="note">For years, anti-racism advocates agreed: no more race-based statistics. In the years since, the tide of public opinion has shifted.</p><p></p><p itemprop="articleBody">Research into racially biased policing has deepened and the public&#x2019;s demand, and appreciation, for data of this kind has grown.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">In the U.S., race data has proven instrumental in revealing problems of discriminatory policing. Some also point to the Star&#x2019;s racial profiling investigations as providing the proof of concept that while race-based statistics can be misused to stigmatize vulnerable groups, they can also be a powerful tool to expose and destroy systemic racism.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s not the collection of data; it&#x2019;s the criminalization of data about us that has been the concern,&#x201D; said Anthony Morgan, a community advocate and lawyer.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;We&#x2019;ve come to a place where we see the power and importance of having more data and we are less fearful of the ways in which that data will be manipulated.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Calls for police to start collecting and releasing race-based data that capture police interactions with the public have grown louder.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">With the <a onclick="theStarLinkClick(event, this)" href="https://www.thestar.com/news/crime/2016/06/06/proactive-policing-will-build-trust-cut-costs-minister-says.html">rewriting of Ontario&#x2019;s Police Services Act</a> and the review of the province&#x2019;s police oversight bodies, both of which are expected to be unveiled in the coming weeks, a rare window of opportunity has opened for the province to mandate that police collect data based on race.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">But 28 years after a disastrous community meeting slammed the door on the practice, is Toronto, and the rest of Ontario, ready for this?</p><p itemprop="articleBody"><hr class="stars"></p><p itemprop="articleBody">For all the angst surrounding race data, collecting the information requires just a small act: checking a box, or pushing a button on a touchscreen.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">The cumulative potential of these small acts can be huge.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">For proof, look no further than Oakland, Calif., home to one of the most controversial law enforcement agencies in the U.S.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">A fact about Oakland: if you are a man in this city of roughly 400,000, police are far more likely to stop you if your skin is black.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Another fact: if you are a black man stopped by Oakland police, you are more likely to be searched, arrested and even spoken to harshly. You have a 1-in-4 chance of being handcuffed, even if you&#x2019;re not arrested.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Oakland&#x2019;s black residents know all this because they live it. Now the rest of the world knows it, too, thanks to statistics published by Stanford University researchers hired by the City of Oakland.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">These findings were revealed by the data, reams of it, pulled from 28,119 forms compiled over the course of a year, recording the race of every Oaklander stopped by police on the street or in a car. The Stanford study produced 50 recommendations to help Oakland police fix a culture &#x201C;whereby it&#x2019;s more acceptable to stop, search, handcuff, and arrest African Americans than whites.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Just 33 have been implemented or initiated. More work lies ahead.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">But these important steps would not have been possible if police weren&#x2019;t collecting data based on race.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;The time when police departments would simply say, &#x2018;We&#x2019;re not going to gather any data&#x2019; is probably in the past,&#x201D; said David A. Harris, a law professor with the University of Pittsburgh and an expert on racial profiling.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;When there&#x2019;s no data, nobody can prove anything one way or the other.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">But like many U.S. police services that now collect race-based data, Oakland police had to be forced to do it.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">They were ordered to do so following a high-profile legal settlement with 119 plaintiffs, most of whom were black. The plaintiffs accused four rogue cops of beatings, kidnappings and falsifying evidence. The plaintiffs were ultimately paid nearly $11 million (U.S.) in damages in 2003, the largest settlement in Oakland&#x2019;s history.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Every other police service in California is now required to collect and publicly report the data through a bill passed by the legislature in 2015.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">In Ontario, many advocates pushing for data to be collected believe that police services here, too, will have to be forced to do it.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">It was this kind of data that showed Ottawa police last year that officers were more likely to pull over Middle Eastern and black male drivers in a traffic stop than those who were white, particularly if the drivers were young.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">The <a onclick="theStarLinkClick(event, this)" href="https://www.thestar.com/opinion/commentary/2016/10/27/racism-in-policing-is-about-outcomes-not-intentions-cole.html">two-year data collection project</a> was the result of a settlement between the Ottawa Police Services Board and the Ontario Human Rights Commission following a complaint by Chad Aiken, a young black man alleging racial profiling.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">The Ottawa police response to the data is part of the reason Renu Mandhane, Ontario&#x2019;s chief human rights commissioner, believes the province is in a &#x201C;hopeful moment.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Ten years ago, Mandhane said, the police response would have been more defensive, far more likely to have included claims that the data showed racialized people commit more traffic crime, and outright denials about the possible role of racial profiling.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">But this was not how Ottawa police responded.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;In my conversations with police leadership, many of them have moved beyond questioning whether racial discrimination, or racism, exists,&#x201D; Mandhane said.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Mandhane and the commission, which has been pushing for the collection of race-based police data for more than a decade, are under no illusions that police will collect the data voluntarily.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">As part of the overhaul of the Police Services Act, which has not been revised for 25 years, the commission is <a onclick="theStarLinkClick(event, this)" href="https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2016/05/26/ontario-human-rights-commission-calls-for-big-changes-in-policing.html">urging the province</a> to require police to collect data on identity, including information on race, in all stops of civilians and incidents involving the use of force.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">The commission <a onclick="theStarLinkClick(event, this)" href="https://www.thestar.com/news/crime/2016/12/01/siu-must-release-investigative-reports-human-rights-commission.html">made the same recommendation</a> to Ontario Court of Appeal Justice Michael Tulloch. For the past year, Tulloch and his team have been reviewing police watchdogs, including the Special Investigations Unit, which <a onclick="theStarLinkClick(event, this)" href="https://www.thestar.com/news/crime/2015/08/16/how-many-black-men-have-been-killed-by-toronto-police-we-cant-know.html">does not collect race data</a> in its probes of fatalities, serious injuries and allegations of sexual assault involving police.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Tulloch&#x2019;s report is due at the end of the month, while the changes to police legislation are expected to be unveiled this spring.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">To many, the success of both turns on the question of race-based data.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;I would argue that the revision of the Police Services Act and the Tulloch Review will not have fulfilled their mandate if neither include provisions for the collection, analysis and dissemination of race-based statistics,&#x201D; said Akwasi Owusu-Bempah, an assistant professor of criminology at the University of Toronto and an expert in race and policing.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Morgan, the lawyer and community advocate, adds that race-based data is a vital part of evidence-based policy making in policing and beyond, including measuring the need for reforms to everything from schools and housing to health and prisons.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;It gives us greater access to the levers of both change and accountability.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody"><hr class="stars"></p><p itemprop="articleBody">If recent developments are any indication, Queen&#x2019;s Park appears to be warming to the idea of race-based data.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Last year, in its <a onclick="theStarLinkClick(event, this)" href="https://www.thestar.com/news/queenspark/2016/03/22/province-updates-carding-regulations-for-police.html">new regulations</a> governing carding, the province mandated that police services release annual statistics on things such as the race, sex and age of those stopped. The children and youth minister also vowed that Ontario&#x2019;s 47 children&#x2019;s aid societies would start collecting race data, as part of efforts to reduce the high number of black kids in care.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Earlier this month, the province&#x2019;s anti-racism directorate <a onclick="theStarLinkClick(event, this)" href="https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2017/03/07/ontario-government-unveils-3-year-plan-to-battle-racism.html">announced proposed legislation </a> that, if passed, will require the collection of data on race and ethnicity within several government sectors, including the justice system.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Asked whether the revised Police Services Act will include direction for police to begin collecting data on race, Yasir Naqvi, Ontario&#x2019;s attorney general, said the new law is under development.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;So much of our work is focused on community-based prevention, evidence-based prevention. In order for that to take place appropriately, to develop community-based evolving plans, you need that data,&#x201D; Naqvi said.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">As for Toronto police, spokesperson Meaghan Gray didn&#x2019;t say whether the service or the police chief would support race-based data collection, but pointed to Ontario&#x2019;s new carding regulations, which require the gathering and reporting of this data.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">The province will likely face strong opposition from chiefs and police associations, says former Kingston police chief Bill Closs, who is now retired.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">In 2003, Closs made the unprecedented move to begin collecting race-based data from stops by his officers. The two-year project showed that black people were stopped three times as often as white people. The revelation prompted a tearful apology from Closs.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">The backlash from inside the policing community was swift: the Kingston Police Association attacked the study. When then premier Dalton McGuinty was asked if he would instruct police services to collect the same data, he said he wouldn&#x2019;t tell police what to do.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">In his 43 years of policing, Closs said the race data project was &#x201C;the most depressing and rewarding time of my life.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;Everybody outside of the government and policing community were congratulating us or were supporting us. But (there was) intense negativity from police chiefs, from police unions and &#x2014; what was bitterly disappointing &#x2014; from the government,&#x201D; Closs said in an interview.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Closs admits his experience left him cynical about the prospects of provincial lawmakers forcing police to collect data involving race, but he said he would like to be &#x201C;pleasantly surprised.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">He stresses that, if police are required to collect the data, it should include officers providing the rationale for their decisions; officers in the Kingston study didn&#x2019;t just mark down the perceived race of the person stopped, but included the reason they pulled over a car or spoke to someone walking down the street. That information provides an all-important glimpse into an officer&#x2019;s mind, the subconscious bias that may exist within good police officers.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">In Closs&#x2019;s experience, race-based data can expose problems, inform officer training and build bridges within the community. </p><p itemprop="articleBody"></p><p annotation="note">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s going to take somebody with the courage, in government, to say, &#x2018;It&#x2019;s time to do this.&#x2019;&#x201D;</p><p></p></div><div class="related_topics" data-reactid="173"><strong data-reactid="174">Read more about: </strong><div class="tags" data-reactid="175"><span data-reactid="176"><a href="/topic.dalton_mcguinty.html" data-reactid="177">Dalton Mcguinty</a></span><span data-reactid="178"><!-- react-text: 179 -->, <!-- /react-text --><a href="/topic.julian_fantino.html" data-reactid="180">Julian Fantino</a></span></div></div><div class="show-for-medium-only alpha__big-box star-touch-banner__article" data-reactid="181"><div class="alpha__big-box__body" data-reactid="182"><div class="" data-reactid="183"><!-- react-empty: 184 --></div></div></div><!-- react-empty: 185 --><div class="newsletter-box show-for-small-only" data-reactid="186"><div class="newsletter-box__body" data-reactid="187"><div class="newsletter-box__body-content" data-reactid="188"><div data-reactid="189"><span class="resist-font-resizer" data-reactid="190">Delivered daily</span><span class="newsletter-box__heading" data-reactid="191">The Morning Headlines&#xA0;Newsletter</span><div class="clearfix" data-reactid="192"><div class="newsletter-box__input-box" data-reactid="193"><input type="email" value="" placeholder="Enter your email address" aria-label="Your email address" class="" data-reactid="194"></div><button class="button" data-reactid="195">Subscribe</button></div></div></div><p class="newsletter-box__legal" data-reactid="196"><!-- react-text: 197 -->The Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E&#xA0;1E6.

In some parts, one in four trees was an American chestnut. The trees were a refuge for hundreds of species and a thrumming industry: its wood was so hardy that chestnut fences still stake Ontario fields.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Then, in less than 50 years, the trees were gone. An exotic blight, accidentally carried over on an Asian chestnut variety, began infecting American chestnuts as the 20th century dawned. By 1950, up to four billion trees had died, two million of them in Ontario, wiping out 99.9 per cent of the species and radically reshaping the forests it once dominated.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Now, a century later, an American research team has an equally unprecedented solution: a genetically modified American chestnut. By splicing a single gene from wheat into the tree&#x2019;s genome, scientists from the State University of New York&#x2019;s College of Environmental Science and Forestry (SUNY-ESF) have engineered blight-resistant saplings.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">This year, the team plans to apply for approval from U.S. and Canadian regulators to distribute the plant.

The American species, however, bore no natural resistance.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">It&#x2019;s hard to overstate the consequences of the loss of the American chestnut, ecologically, commercially and culturally. The trees dominated the forest canopy, produced massive volumes of nuts, and shed a particularly protein-rich leaf litter, providing shelter and nourishment for other species.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">When the tree was wiped out, multiple species of insects went extinct almost immediately, and many other animals, from deer to bears to wild turkeys, were impacted. Some scientists wonder whether the loss of the American chestnut contributed to the extinction of the passenger pigeon, since the soaring, 35-metre-high trees provided roosts for birds and both died out around the same time.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">As commercial timber, Americans &#x201C;called it the cradle to grave wood, since almost all everyday items were made of chestnut,&#x201D; says Ron Casier, chair of the Canadian Chestnut Council, a conservation group. Its supreme rot resistance made it a favourite for log cabins, flooring, and railroad ties. Nuts from the tree were a common food, as North American holiday traditions still suggest.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">In a single human generation, a geological wink, the tree disappeared.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;That&#x2019;s pretty much the most important wipeout of a species by a pathogen &#x2014; I can&#x2019;t think of anything else on that scale,&#x201D; says Richard Hamelin, a professor of forest pathology at the University of British Columbia.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Because the tree is so &#x201C;iconic,&#x201D; says Hamelin, &#x201C;ever since I did my PhD &#x2014; and before that, of course &#x2014; people have been interested in its restoration.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">The fungus creates cankers that girdle the trunk and branches, but it does not affect the roots. Decades after the trees died off, stump rings still pock the countryside, sending up shoots that then become infected and die. This cycle gives researchers hope &#x2014; and more importantly, if the trees survive long enough to flower, seeds.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">For decades, researchers have been trying to crossbreed the naturally resistant Asian chestnut species with the American. But the offspring of these trees are smaller hybrids, so the ones with blight resistance are then selected and &#x201C;back-crossed&#x201D; with another American chestnut tree to create offspring that are genetically truer to the endangered species.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Through enough generations of crossing and back-crossing, a tree that is blight-resistant and mostly American chestnut would be created. But the tree takes years to reach sexual maturity, so this research has been painstakingly slow, and has not yet produced trees with high levels of resistance.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Researchers also tried a tactic called hypovirulence, which uses a virus to infect the fungus, making it less potent. It didn&#x2019;t pan out, but it gave researchers a clue. The weaker strains of fungus produced less of a substance called oxalic acid &#x2014; a hint that this was the fungus&#x2019; weapon.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Powell and his colleagues noted that wheat and other grasses carry a gene that produces an enzyme that defangs oxalic acid, transforming it into two harmless byproducts, carbon dioxide and hydrogen peroxide. By splicing this gene into the American chestnut genome, the SUNY-ESF team theorized they could create a blight-resistant tree.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">It sounds simple. It took Powell and his colleagues 27 years. &#x201C;We started off when no one was doing this stuff,&#x201D; he says.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">The lab planted their first transgenic American chestnut trees in an outdoor research plot in 2006, ones with &#x201C;intermediate&#x201D; levels of blight resistance. Recent tests have shown even better defences, matching or surpassing the Asian trees; these highly resistant trees will be planted in the New York Botanical Garden this year.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">As early as summer, Powell and his team will begin applying to U.S. federal agencies for approval to distribute the plant to the public. As soon as those reviews are initiated, they will reformat their documents and submit to Environment Canada and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.</p></div><figure class="image" data-reactid="165"><div class="image__body " data-reactid="166"><img src="https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/news/world/2017/03/18/science-finds-a-way-to-bring-back-the-american-chestnut-tree/williampowell.jpg.size.custom.crop.850x624.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 850px) 850px, 100vw" srcset="https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/news/world/2017/03/18/science-finds-a-way-to-bring-back-the-american-chestnut-tree/williampowell.jpg.size.custom.crop.320x234.jpg 320w, https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/news/world/2017/03/18/science-finds-a-way-to-bring-back-the-american-chestnut-tree/williampowell.jpg.size.custom.crop.480x352.jpg 480w, https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/news/world/2017/03/18/science-finds-a-way-to-bring-back-the-american-chestnut-tree/williampowell.jpg.size.custom.crop.640x469.jpg 640w, https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/news/world/2017/03/18/science-finds-a-way-to-bring-back-the-american-chestnut-tree/williampowell.jpg.size.custom.crop.850x624.jpg 850w" alt="Professor William Powell hopes his team&apos;s research sets a precedent for others trying to save wild plants threatened by invasive pests and pathogens." data-reactid="167"></div><figcaption data-reactid="168"><!-- react-text: 169 -->Professor William Powell hopes his team&apos;s research sets a precedent for others trying to save wild plants threatened by invasive pests and pathogens.<!-- /react-text --></figcaption></figure><div data-reactid="170"><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;What we want to do is quickly get their approval too so we can plant up there.

Each agency has a different package of requirements.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s always harder to be the first,&#x201D; Powell says, adding that he hopes this sets a precedent for other researchers trying to save wild plants threatened by invasive pests and pathogens.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">With any intervention into nature, there are unknowns. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s always a risk because it&#x2019;s biology,&#x201D; says Hamelin, the forest pathology researcher.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Horizontal gene transfer, the transmission of DNA between species, is far less common in multicellular organisms like plants than in bacteria, but scientists are discovering more and more instances of it. Powell doesn&#x2019;t believe this is an overwhelming concern, in part because the oxalic acid neutralizing enzyme is found in so many plants, including bananas and strawberries.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">A more pressing scenario, one often encountered by agricultural biotechnologists, is a genetic arms race between the transgenic tree and the fungus. The tree would carry a single gene conferring resistance and takes years to mature. The pathogen produces billions of spores in that time, and each is an opportunity to mutate &#x2014; an &#x201C;unfair advantage,&#x201D; Hamelin notes. In a discussion of the transgenic tree, &#x201C;this issue has to be addressed.&#x201D;</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Powell says that his team&#x2019;s approach, which doesn&#x2019;t attack the fungus itself, lessens the selective pressure to beat the tree&#x2019;s gene. The lab is also working with groups that are crossing and back-crossing the Asian and American chestnuts, exploring ways to &#x201C;stack&#x201D; resistance genes &#x2014; a platoon approach.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">UBC&#x2019;s Aitken says Powell is &#x201C;doing great work,&#x201D; in part because his lab has taken pains to keep their work transparent &#x2014; a chance for fruitful dialogue.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;In addition to having great potential for getting American chestnut back out on the landscape and increasing the diversity of species in the forest and providing food for all those creatures that eat chestnuts and all those good things, it also provides us with a good example of one use of genetic modification that isn&#x2019;t tangled up with profit and patent and genetic control of resources,&#x201D; Aitken says.

instructed by his office to vote against it.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">The councillor pushing for that equality says the move by Tory smacks of &#x201C;dishonesty,&#x201D; what preceded his participation in International Women&#x2019;s Day events earlier this month.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">At a February meeting of council where the 2017 budget was finalized, Councillor Kristyn Wong-Tam (Ward 27 Toronto Centre-Rosedale) moved a motion asking staff to develop a gender-based framework to look at next year&#x2019;s budget and the impacts of budgetary and policy decisions on various genders, something Prime Minister Justin Trudeau&#x2019;s Liberal government is planning for the upcoming 2017 budget.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Wong-Tam&#x2019;s motion passed 26 to 18 with Tory&#x2019;s support.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">But what Wong-Tam didn&#x2019;t know at the time is that what&#x2019;s known at city hall as a cheat sheet was circulated by the mayor&#x2019;s office to councillors allied with the mayor. That cheat sheet, which the Star has seen a copy of, told those councillors to vote against her motion. Seven of Tory&#x2019;s hand-picked executive members voted against the motion.</p></div><div class="show-for-small-only alpha__big-box " data-reactid="155"><div class="article-continued" data-reactid="156"><div class="article-continued__heading" data-reactid="157">Article Continued Below</div></div><div class="alpha__big-box__body" data-reactid="158"><div class="big-box" data-reactid="159"><!-- react-empty: 160 --></div></div></div><div data-reactid="161"><p itemprop="articleBody">Wong-Tam told the Star she was disappointed to learn about the cheat sheet instructions after the vote, saying she believed she had the mayor&#x2019;s support after speaking with him that morning.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;You can&#x2019;t stand publicly and purport that you support gender equality and that you can not stand in front of audience of women and tell them how important their economic participation is in civic life and that you&#x2019;ll do everything you can to ensure that you can help, which was his message during International Women&#x2019;s Day . . . and then be working behind the scenes to undermine those efforts to achieve equality,&#x201D; she said.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">The Star has also learned Tory voted in favour of adding a new position to the city&#x2019;s newcomer office, which helps with resettling refugees, while the cheat sheet instructed others to do the opposite.</p></div><div id="fsk_splitbox" data-reactid="162"></div><!-- react-empty: 163 --><div data-reactid="164"><p itemprop="articleBody">Tory has publicly advocated for Toronto as a welcome haven for refugees and is sponsoring a Syrian family as part of a private group.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Mihevc&#x2019;s motion narrowly passed in a 24 to 20 vote.
